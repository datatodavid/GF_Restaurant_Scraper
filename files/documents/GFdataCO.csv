I have found many gf donuts in denver. But nothing and I mean notta single donut will compare to their donut holes.
We found this place one day and I did the ah huh to my husband for writing it down and really I forgot after procrastinating while being selfish and refusing to share my new found glorious donut holes of deliciousness and yes you may drewl. Months pass and the hunt continues then one Saturday morning my husband is giving me directions to the possibility of delicious donuts. We end up on the same road same, round abouts in the opposite direction but headed back. Excitment.
I splurged. It was worth it.
This business is forever saved.
Donut holes, muffin, egg bacon sandwich, coffees and a smoothie. The berry smoothie is a bit tart for a toddler. Lesson learned.

They are very careful about cross contamination in the kitchen - the girl on the phone told me the owners have celiac also. Separate fryer. The fries were delicious but I have to say I was rather disappointed in the burger. It was pretty sub-par. My boyfriend thought his burger was good though. However, the meal filled me up and I didn't have any gluten reaction., Yummiest food I've had in a while.

I feel very safe here and will definitely be going back., Great place, staff is very knowledgeable. The only items they can’t adjust to be GF are the onion rings and the soft pretzel. They have a separate fryer for GF. My celiac daughter enjoyed the sweet potato fries and fried artichokes, as well as the Asian fish tacos., This place was so good! Almost everything on their menu can be made GF and they have a huge selection of GF beers and drinks. The absolute highlight is that after telling our waiter I had celiac, the manager came by to further explain the steps they take to ensure no CC, that the owners are celiac and they take it very seriously, and finally ask if you have any additional questions that they can answer so you feel safe eating there! ... Food was delicious- especially the fries!, Outstanding Juicy Lucy burger and sweet potato fries. Next time will try the fish and chips, 5 stars aren't enough. Celiac Owners and very knowledgeable staff. Huge GF menu with lots of options I haven't seen anywhere else. Food was fantastic. Also GF beers and ciders, of course. I was here for lunch and there were families. Felt completely safe and will definitely be back., Good meal. Had fish and chips plus Chichen bites for an app. Paid $32 with tip for myself., Great good.

You cant get GF bar food like this anywhere else. Amazing menu., We gave them a go based on the reviews here and we were not disappointed! The server was super friendly and explained that they have dedicated fryers, work areas and dishes. Gluten free dishes are served on oval or round dishes, while non gluten free food is served on or in square dishes. They were so accommodating that the server double checked to make sure the pickles didn't have artificial dye in them. I eat gluten while the hubby doesn't and he is very sensitive to gluten and had no reaction at all. He ate potatoes skins, beer batter fish and fries. He enjoyed it so much we went again and he got a burger and fries.

My new favorite place in Denver., Delicious food and almost anything can be made gf! They have a dedicated fryer., This place is spectacular. When I asked about gluten free options, the server told me that everything (besides the onion rings and pretzel bites) is naturally gluten free or can be made gluten free. The owners have Celiac and have taken all necessary precautions with separate spaces, fryer, etc. They also had gluten free beer and cider on their happy hour menu!, This place is amazing. As soon as I asked about a gluten free menu, the host sat down with me and went through all of my options (which is EVERYTHING but the onion rings and pretzels) as well as all of their precautions to avoid CC- separate prep area, fryer, draft lines, and even plates. The food was delicious and hearty. The owners both have Celiac and their daughter has a peanut allergy so they any dietary restriction VERY seriously., The pork belly Bahan mi was amazing! I'm not used to having so many options, it took me a while to only pick one!, So good!! The potato chips and house made ranch are awesome!! GF fish and chips...YUM!

Great food!, Staff was super knowledgeable even down to knowing I couldn’t have malt vinegar. I had the fish and homemade chips. It was literally one of THE BEST gluten-free hearty meals I’ve ever had., They try really hard here and have tons of options. Unfortunately, the crouton that found it's way into my salad illustrates just how challenging it is to make things Celiac safe in a facility that isn't dedicated. A for effort., The best Gf place to get a burger! Went here with my husband who is not Gf, but the owner came out to make sure everything was safe for me. The food was soooo good! The bun was great on the burger! Def recommend!, Wow! I can't tell you how long it's been since I've had fish & chips.

Can’t fault the restaurant for trying to go local. The fries were crunchy and flavorful. Loved it!, We love this joint!

Almost the entire menu is gluten free and the margaritas are delicious, This was our first time here, and I asked the hostess about GF food to make sure it would be safe for our daughter. They have mostly GF food and menu items with gluten are clearly marked. They have a dedicated fryer for GF chips.The street tacos were tasty! There's a kids menu with GF items. Daughter had no reaction after eating there, so another restaurant we can add to our list of acceptable places! Cool outdoor seating great for people watching, music, etc. Inside was nice too. This is a chain, but I didn't know that at the time., Ordered the kids chicken taco and a fruit skewer for my 6yo son with Celiac. I called the day before and they told me that typically the child’s tacos come with a flour tortilla, so I made sure when we called to order I mentioned it was for a child with Celiac and specifically asked for a corn tortilla. They clearly marked this on the ticket (we saw it taped to the bag at pickup). When my husband picked up the food, they said that they only have corn tortillas that are gluten free. Only thing on the menu with gluten are the churros. Reasonably priced and delicious! Our son is somewhat picky and after the first two bites said the taco was delicious! We’ll be back!, Amazing food, one of our favorites! Most items are GF and servers are knowledge. We eat their food just about weekly!, Almost everything was GF. As my wife is the only GF person in the house being able to order the family platter of tacos and have the whole thing be GF was awesome. They also have an allergy matrix which is very easy to read and there only seemed to be deserts and kids items that had gluten. Curbside pickup in Reston was also seamless. The food was ready right at the estimated time of pickup from ordering online., Great place, delicious food! However the fryers are NOT dedicated to gluten free foods. I had the baja fish tacos and was told they were gluten free. The batter coating is gluten free but the fryers are not because they also fry churros in therm so I had a reaction after eating them. Other than the fryers, they are celiac friendly and otherwise knowledgable about gluten containing food items!, The staff was able to answer all of my questions. They have 7 fryers and all but one is gluten free. Everything is served with corn tortillas unless otherwise specified. All alcoholic drinks except some beer were gluten free. Can eat most of what’s on the menu.... Lobster and fried fish taco are excellent! Was able to eat the homemade chips and salsa which were also very good. Most items are gluten free.... This location doesn’t have table service you order online after downloading the QR code. At first it’s kind of a hassle since no one is there to Answer questions but they are helpful once you get someone to your table. After figuring it out it’s quite convenient. And ordering additional food or drinks is very convenient as well. Service was quick, Of the 4 times my Celiac daughters and I have eaten here, they messed up once and badly glutened my daughter with the supposed gluten free Baja Fish Tacos.... While the food tasted good on our many visits, they screwed up and glutened my Celiac daughter on our last (and final) visit., Most of the tacos are and just make sure to specify. Can do guacamole and chips too!, There are many GF options. I am allergic to casein and eggs as well and the staff are right on in this area. I have never had an issue and I eat there three times per month. The food is excellent and I recommend the salsa verde (YUM!) I put it on everything and it’s so fresh every time.
The staff at Bartaco Stamford are very friendly and allergy aware. They immediately notify the manager of the GF order and double check the allergies with items ordered with the manager. I feel very safe eating here and I recommend it highly. It’s actually the only restaurant in Stamford besides Teff that I feel safe eating at or from. If you go on their website they list every item on the menu with the top allergens including gluten for each item in a graph type layout., This is a corporate chain taco place, but damn if it ain't good. The majority of the menu is GF. And everything I've tried is tasty. I've probably been here too many times at the expense of my other local taco joints. Shout out to Taqueria la Vaquita and Super Taqueria!, Tasty food. Many gluten free options... including fried fish with no cross contamination.... Yummy!... Staff knows how important gf is., Claudia and manager Patrick are amazing. We are celiac and they have a rice batter on fish tacos and oysters tacos that are unbelievably delicious! Please visit, so delicious!, GF friendly and they speak with confidence about the menu (can’t eat empanadas.or churros)., Bartaco is so delicious and almost every menu item is GF. I went to Bartaco 3 times in 2 weeks after I found out about my gluten sensitivity. Can’t wait to go back!, In love with the service and food!!!!, No reaction great options . Little spicy on some things when you don't expect it but great flavor., Delicious, spicy Salsa Rojo. Tacos were good. Great setting and location. Menu all GF except desserts., I’m a very sensitive celiac and this has been my go-to place for months. Never had any issues at any of the locations!, Rather than marking what’s gluten free on the menu, they mark what isn’t, which makes sense considering almost the entire menu is gluten free. Great food, and plenty of choices., The staff was very helpful and walked me through the menu. There are vegan options as well (the cauliflower and Brussels sprouts tacos were delicious). Really good flavors in all the food. My friends who are not gluten free enjoyed the food as much as I did., Basically whole menu is gluten free and dairy free friendly. Highly reccomend. Make sure you get there early, it fills up fast, Everything on menu GF except deserts and pork tacos. Great atmosphere and delicious food. After chips and three different salsa type dishes, devoured several street tacos and half roasted chicken.
We will be back!, Not only is the food excellent but almost the entire menu is gluten free (the desserts contain gluten besides ice cream)! There also are separate fryers for GF items. Order by checking boxes on a card and there is a clear spot to specify your allergies. Servers were extremely knowledgeable about Celiac. I tested the tortilla chips, roja salsa, and chicken empanadas with my Nima Sensor and no gluten was found! I also ate a chicken and pork taco and did not feel the need to test any further - did not get sick. Food, drinks, atmosphere, and staff are awesome. Highly recommend!, Wow! My new obsession! Guac was fresh and phenomenal. I love that every taco BUT the carnitas is GF. The baja were great and the pork belly were my absolute favorite. The manager told us how serious they take celiac... a manager handles the ticket and they use a red card to show whats gf and whats not. An awesome find!, Super delicious! Great taco spot! Have a margarita! All fresh ingredients. Definitely recommend., Excellent food! Chips are safe and the guacamole is amazing!, Great restaurant and almost everything on the menu is gf - even their fried options., My daughter loved her GF quesadillas, however she got sick from them. Just spoke to restaurant- said they can confirm quesadillas were GF but they were “horrified” to tell me they were cooked on a shared surface that cooks flour tortilla quesadillas. However, when I spoke to the waitress when ordering, she seemed to understand my daughter couldn’t tolerate cross contamination and I wrote this in the allergy section of the ticket... We thought the food was good, would go back without her, just not celiac safe if you order quesadillas..: though there are mainly all gluten free menu options besides the flour tortilla quesadilla!, This place is sooo cute, fun music, friendly staff, delicious food. Let them know you are gf.. they take it serious. Have gf tacos. Pork tacos are not gf. Must order guac+Roja+vieja !! FYI their “grilled” chicken is like rotisserie (mixture of white and dark meat). Chicken chorizo taco and bowls are to die for lol
Must try at Seaport!!, Outstanding! Those street corn fritters are heavenly!, There are more gluten-free things on their menu than non gluten-free so they mark the things with gluten. The staff is super great about explaining everything to you and their allergy process not just for gluten but any allergy. They use a separate order card and tray for customers with dietary restrictions. I've eaten here twice and not gotten sick. It's also very nice that they use a gluten free flour in their breaded fish.... Some of the best tacos in town. I love that you can mix and match different kinds. I highly recommend the brussel sprouts taco., Many GF options. Their tacos are small and I’ve definitely tasted better. However, cool atmosphere and the plantains are phenomenal!, So delicious! Almost everything is GF. Chips are made in a separate fryer and so are the seafood items., Like their other locations they take allergies and Celiac seriously. Dedicated fryers for individual items and unusual gluten-free treats (did someone say corn fritters?!?). Greatly recommend the Brussel Sprouts taco, man that sauce 🤤!, Very few items with gluten actually in them on the menu. I love that you order by filling out a form so I could note the gluten concerns and not have to explain another time. The waiter also reviewed it with me., great atmosphere, delicious and safe for celiacs! no reaction at all! i will definitely be back., They have a fully gluten free menu except just a few items. Tacos all come in GF corn tortillas and most other items are GF. Delicious and safe. Brand new also. Just opened 3 months ago. Have also been to the location in NY. Same menu. Both amazing, This is the third city I’ve eaten at a Bartaco. All three are exactly the same.... AMAZING! Sooooo delicious and so many gluten free options!, The staff is always on top of the celiac accommodation. They make it so easy. They are also so friendly and professional. I took my very sensitive celiac child and she loved it., Great atmosphere, super yummy tacos and guacamole. Everything we had was great. Very accommodating for celiac and felt safe. Highly recommended if you’re in the area for Disney or Universal., Delicious! The chicken soup was amazing and so were all the tacos (shrimp, fish, duck, and portobello). The rice bowl was fine, but probably wouldn’t order it again considering how amazing the tacos are. Virtually everything is gluten free. Highly recommend., Their menu was almost entirely gluten free and everything that was not was very clearly marked. Tons of options to choose from! I had the lunch platter with a cauliflower, mushroom, and chicken pastor taco with a side of chicken soup. I also added a pork belly taco. The chips and salsa and guacamole platter was also gf. The staff was extremely knowledgeable and informed me that they would clear an area to cook on for me. This was my favorite meal in Nashville!! I would recommend to everyone celiac or not. UPDATE: I did go here on another trip to Nashville and wanted to order the mojo pork carnitas. They did let me know they were made with a GLUTEN REMOVED beer so they weren't safe for celiac! This wasn't listed on the menu so be careful with that., Food was very good, a little spicy but good., The staff was fantastic about my gluten and soy intolerance! Very helpful, good food, creative menu. I’ll go back!, Great GF options! The tacos are awesome!, First question asked after I said it was my first time was “do you have any food allergies?”. Most of their menu items are gluten free! Highly recommend Bartaco!, The corn fritters are amazing!, Most of the option are GF!! The chicken chorizo tacos were awesome! The margaritas, delish! A must try!, Staff was knowledgeable. Food was delicious. They went the extra mile to check on ingredients for me. We went back to eat again because they did such a great job., This place is amazing. First thing I noticed is that the interior of this place is really really well done and I don't normally notice that kinda stuff. I just remember what this building looked like when the last business occupied it and it looked nothing like it does today. On top of that, literally everything I have had here is amazing. Pork belly tacos are so so good, guac is as fresh as it gets, steak tacos are tender. Even tried the coconut gelato, best i have ever had. Also my wife has celiac and just about everything is gluten free!, Staff were very knowledgeable and made sure to make everything gluten free. I am also allergic to dairy, and they had many options! Wonderful food and great ambiance. Highly recommended!","Sophie,J.

There is no dedicated fryer, and there is a large chance of getting cross contamination. I used to think it was ok to eat here before I really experienced symptoms. Everytime I have been in the last couple of years, and reassured by a manager that my meal was gluten free, I've gotten sick., The staff was very knowledgeable about my gluten free needs. I have never been sick from eating here and the food is great!, Celiac. They tried but not very knowledgeable., Ate here twice on a business trip. They are aware of celiacs. They have dedicated fryers for their fries. They also can make burgers with GF flat bread, which I found actually nice. They don't guarantee there is no cross-contamination, but they do try to take precautions and I did not get sick., First, it's very expensive for small portions.... When we arrived, the waitress said, ""All fryers are gluten free."" Ordered something with onion rings on it and when I asked what they were breaded with, she says, ""Oh yeah they have gluten, all onion rings have gluten in them."" She was pretty rude about it and I asked her why she said the fryers were all gluten free and she said that's not what she meant. Like wth? Anyway, not coming back here., Delicious fries from dedicated fryer and campfire marshmallow ice cream in a cup. They told me if you mention celiac/food allergy, they scoop the ice cream from the barrel, not the containers that most people are served out of, to prevent cross contamination. Felt great after., Delicious burger and a dedicated fryer too! Some of the best fries I’ve had in a long time, I had a great experience here, their fries are from a dedicated fryer and the waiter was very attentive and put in an allergy warning. Also delicious!, They have GF flat bread to put burgers on and the fries are made in a dedicated frier. Very good food. Burgers are $12-15 range plus $2 upgrade for GF. Also have some GF drinks, Advertised to me as a gluten free/gluten friendly location to visit while in Denver. Both the chef and kitchen manager report nothing to be safe for real sensitivities, the 'gluten free' label was made for people interested in a diet, not for those with rela health needs. They reported no dedicated space recommendedin the kitchen and advised a salad or another restaurant. Server very nice, not knowledgeable about allergies., Best food ever! Almost everything is gluten free, for the future I would highly recommend this place!, Staff was knowledgeable and there’s a separate fryer for French fries!, This review is long overdue, but I went to look at this place again to try it maybe a year later and I'm glad I looked because it seems like others are having issues. I had an awful experience. Poorly trained staff, gave me very mixed options, some said I could have any sauce, some said I could only have ketchup. Did not feel safe eating here, AT ALL. Fries came out with barbeque sauce, after they told me it wasn't gf. Didn't seem like they took gf seriously at all., Food was delicious. Unfortunately, I got glutened. I was assured that fries used separate fryers and burgers were gluten free, as were all sauces. I ordered with instruction from the waiter, and I saw they marked “gluten allergy” on my ticket. And still, I am sick. Beware of cross-contamination in this kitchen., I was drawn to try this place since it was near my hotel, and I could actually have fries! But when we were seated, my waitress informed me that they don’t have dedicated fryers and they weren’t recommended for celiacs bc of a high likelihood of cross contamination. I decided to Nima rest a fry anyway since so many raves about them, and gluten was found! I ordered the fly fisher sandwich on a gf wrap, though, and it was great. I did have to ask for them to cook it on a piece of aluminum foil bc they cook the burger and warm the pita in the grill where everything else is cooked and could have cc, but they were very accommodating. The manager came out and assured me they were being very careful, changed gloves, etc, and Nima approved! Here I am a day lady, feeling great. So I know it was definitely gf! And it was yummy!, Enjoyed a great lunch while in Denver for a conference. Had a slider on GF flatbread (like a pita), GF fries, Brussels sprouts, chips and a variety of dips. All was delicious!, Came here with a really big group for a work event. We'd informed them when we made the reservation that we have a few people with gluten allergies, and the staff was great about making sure we got what we needed and informing us if they brought out a shared appetizer that we should avoid. I loved having a burger (gf bun) and fries., The service was great! I was able to have fries! They offered to make my burger with a lettuce wrap or the gluten free flat bread. I choose the flat bread it wasn't bad. I came back recently and they said it got to busy for them to have a seperate fryer. The food was still great., I’ve brought my Nima sensor in and twice found gluten in my “celiac friendly” burger. They do carry fully GF beer, though..., Awesome burgers and fries. Get the fly fisher! Sometimes its busy and confusing in the restaurant but its downtown Denver give the staff a break! They are really helpful with questions about CC or celiacs, Had 5280 Chicken Breast on GF flatbread and fries. No trouble with either. Great place. Busy when we were there and waitress still took time to address GF issues., Had chili cheese fries, delicious! unfortunately when my burger came out, had regular bun. I asked right away if it was gluten free (already knowing it wasn't because it looked the same like my friends burger and they have GF FLATBREAD, not buns. The flatbread is delicious. They immediately took it back and said they would recook the entire burger. So I got the burger, but after others were done eating 4 stars for wasting time, they comped my burger, food is good and not too many complaints because they tried! My friends loved their burger. Be specific up front that you have celiac, don't just request gf option., Had their mushroom burger on their flatbread...it was really good. Also had their fries. No problems for me. Low-Sensitivity Celiac., Great gourmet burgers on GF flatbread. Hand cut fries., Great food and fries were gluten free. The flatbread bun was very good and the burger delicious., Good food. I’m not a burger person so I had chicken breast instead of a burger (which is a normal substitution on the menu). Dedicated fryer for fries. They were okay but not the best fries I ever had. They serve a gf flatbread, but since I decided to chow down on fries I didn’t end up eating much of the flatbread., Really delicious gf flatbread “bun”. The fries were good too. Staff was helpful and knowledgeable., just ate there. knowledgeable staff. I'm celiac and gluten free. I got a little glutened with a brain fog from the fries, but I'm not sure if they made those in the right fryer. it was busy and maybe too busy to assure gluten and dairy free food. I might try it again if I'm in a pinch but since I'm not feeling well after eating there, I will probably steer clear., Excellent burgers and celiac friendly. I eat fries so rarely, due to cross contamination concerns, but 5280 has a dedicated frier... So no worries! Crispy brussel sprouts are super tasty., Fries were good and so nice not to worry ! Waitress double checked specific items for me. Flat bread was ok, really. Angus burger was excellent. Good quality beef!, Really good burgers! The flatbread was good too, not your usual burger bun but I didn't feel second classed at all. So nice to have really good fries and a good atmosphere too. Go here if you're in town! Plus, alcoholic milkshakes and homemade ice cream in their store next door... we may need to come back for those..., Highly recommend. The flatbread that it comes on isn't outstanding, but to have fries and peace of mind when eating is worth it. The burger itself was pretty good too. Server was very knowledgeable., My first visit was awesome! I had a chicken burger and it was great! Loved the GF bread. My second trip was less awesome. The chicken burger didn't have the same WOW factor. Good place for GF burgers and fries., We ordered the street tacos which were pretty good. We also ordered the ""perfect burger"". I did not care for it. Its served on cardboard thin flat ""bread"" and there is a $4 yo charge for it!!!!! It was horrible, didn't even eat. However, the tacos or the bite of burger did not make us sick., Food was awesome! Dedicated GF fryer for fries. All meat is brought in fresh everyday.

Would definitely recommend going out of your way to stop by., Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! Wish there were more around the country! Their beers rival Amy with gluten and are probably better! 😍, Very delicious, celiac friendly, and even non-gluten free friends enjoyed - HIGHLY recommend!, Delicious!... We had gf fish and chips and fried cheese curds for the food truck. Sampled the beer and the pumpkin was delicious too. Ginger Beer and Root Beer were great too. I'd definitely go back., Stopped in for food truck tacos and a couple of G/F beers, both were delicious. No noticeable gluten effects. Albeit the bar was too busy to ask some questions involving the brewing of the beers. On my next visit, I will pack along my Gluten tester(Nima) and test some of the beers and the truck food for gluten since I am Celiac., This place has really good gluten-free beer made solely from gluten-free grains. I had their stout and their pumpkin ale, both were equally delicious., I was so excited to find a brewery where every beer is gluten free! And the “cherry on top” was all the food choices from the food truck parked outside were also GF! The beer offerings were wonderful and the vibe in the brewery was fun and friendly with great decor. The food truck today was Fire in the Hatch. My husband and I shared a dish with pulled pork, bbq sauce (on the side), grilled corn, French fries, and grilled bread. Everything was fresh, flavorful, and delicious! Definitely recommend this establishment for everyone, especially for anyone who needs to follow a GF diet and wants to enjoy having a beer with their non-GF companions., AMAZING! the best GF beer I've ever had. It truly does not taste like any other GF beer and that's a great thing. The service was really good and very helpful also. I loved the atmosphere, but I hope they start carrying this beer closer to where I live., I loved this place! Not only is the beer great, but the staff is warm and welcoming. We went a little out of our way on vacation to go here and I’m so glad we did. It was so fun to go to a brewery and taste several different beers. If only they would open a second location a few hundred miles east!, So many food truck options that I didn't know were gluten free until this brewery opened!!! The beer is great too. Just wish there was a bit more seating available., This is a must do if you are ever in the area !, Came to Denver on vacation and knew the hubby and I had to come here. I’ve never been a beer fan even before being diagnosed with celiacs. But it was great to finally share this with my husband who is a beer snob and loves alllll beer. He def loves the Fat Randy IPA. Def worth the drive to Golden. We went on a Monday and they didn’t have a food truck but all the other days they usually do which are also all 100% GF, So many different kinds of GF beer! My friends and I had flights to try all the different beers. We all agreed that there was only one beer that tasted like a typical GF beer all the rest were just interesting beers to try! It was so nice to have a Stout again! They had a GF food truck outside while we were there and the fries/cheese curds were really great! The cheese bread was just so-so., Dedicated gluten-free facility. If you miss beer, this is the place to go! IPA is the most popular, and it’s delicious! They use quinoa and millet malt!, Great beer, and 100% gluten free. It's hard to find a real gluten free beer (not gluten removed), and Holidaily manages to make great beer that is also gluten free. Can't recommend enough., Gluten free, yes. Delicious, no. I grew up allergic to beer and do not have a palate for it. Won't start now. Be careful of tree-nut allergies here, some beers are made with tree nuts., What a treat! The beer was excellent and the gf pizza was so tasty. There were at least six people there who were not gluten free but go to Holidaily Brewery because the beer is that good. My husband liked the Bomb Cyclone and I liked the Hazy. Also, he liked the Stout and I liked the Porter. It was so nice to have a variety to choose from. Good job Holidaily!!, Love this place! Makes me forget about having Celiac. The flights are great - it’s fun to sample the different beers. I too wish it was closer, but I’m finding it in more liquor stores (I buy it every time even if I don’t need it just to show support!) & I hear it’s at Max Taps in Centennial. It’s not only a brand I trust, but it’s really good too!, Hi Alie, thanks for leaving such a kind review! You can find all locations that carry Holidaily on our website: https://holidailybrewing.com/buy/...

Very impressed with the facility and the beer., Cheers! Glad you enjoyed the Double IPA. We have another big beer that will be released January 1, our Belgian Quad. Hope to have you back again soon., Delicious! If you love beer definitely stop by here. The best IPA I've had since I was diagnosed with Celiac disease. Their chili stout is amazing too., Wow, thank you Jane! That's great to hear. Cheers!, Fantastic brewery!! Having celiac makes my beer choices pretty slim. Being able to stop at a totally GF brewery is the best. The Wild Child Apricot Blonde is my fave followed by the Riva Stout. The pumpkin ale was a delightful treat! Stop in for a visit. You won’t be disappointed!, Awesome place! First time that I had a gf beer on tap! They even had a gf truck there. The food was delicious too! I highly recommend this place., Love being in a safe brewery. Everything was very good and love the gluten free food truck s, Absolutely awesome! Knowledgeable staff and delicious beer!!, Friendly staff. Great selection of beer! I sampled 4 or 5 before settling on the Honey Blonde. My mom (not gluten free and a beer lover) agreed these were some amazing beers., If you've tried other standard GF beer options, you know that saying that Holidaily is the BEST GF beer isn't really saying a whole lot. But it IS the best GF beer I've ever had, and by a wide margin - I had practically given up on the possibility of GF beer even tasting remotely good, but I swear I almost cried the first time I had Holidaily. My hat goes off to them for being passionate about what they do and cracking the nut of good-tasting gluten-free beer. I've brought non-celiacs here, and not only can't they tell it's gluten-free, but they love it as well. Super nice people, and great great great beer., We love this brewery and are here often in the summer with our food truck, The French Twist, which has an entirely gluten free menu, including our Frog Provencal and our Croque Madame. It has a cute patio, too and the people who own it are super nice., Awesome place!
Celiacs gold mine!, Such a great place and a few options on tap which is so nice the staff is so friendly! Karen the owner is an absolute sweetheart and the bartenders are top notch! Will is a great dude!, Amazing beer!!!! This is a dedicated gluten free brewery. Try the flight because all the beer is delicious. I was torn between the IPA and the amber (I haven't had an amber since my diagnosis). They had a gluten free fried chicken food truck outside, which was also very yummy., Beer heaven for celiacs. If you are gluten-free and have given up beer, you need to try this place. The buckwit Belgian is just good beer, not good for gluten-free. The tight ship Belgian double is also fantastic. If you like ales they also have several good ales., Outstanding. I almost cried from joy when I tasted their double IPA - being highly gluten-intolerant, I thought I'd never taste a beer that good again. It was so nice to be somewhere that I didn't have to settle for something that is supposedly gluten free and doesn't taste as good as what all my friends are drinking.
Food trucks parked outside too, all of which have at least 2 GF options. I ate 'safe' fried pickles for the first time in years!!
Their vibe is awesome, it's a beautiful space (great patio!) and the beer is so good even my husband, who is a homebrew competition judge, thought it was on point.
Please go support this gem - there need to be more places like this!, Gluten free brewing company! About six great beers available.

Couldn't be happier to have a place to have beers and feel SAFE!, Great experience. Loved having a good beer after so long. Even my family that drinks beer didn't know that it was GF!

I'm a severe celiac and can't eat anywhere, had to make sandwiches while the family ate out., I have no words! The Old '93 Porter is to die for!!!

It’s nice to go here where there are other places in case someone else wants different food. However, I went there with other people who are not gluten free, and the drink waitress (who works for Avanti, not the arepa stall) mixed up our drink orders.

You could tell they put a lot of thought in to the look of the restaurant, Utterly phenomenal. You'll only wish ya coulda ordered more., The entire place is gluten free (except beer) and everything is delicious and amazing. Fried food, baked goods - all the usual no-gos are good-to-go here!, The food is gluten free and very good but they offer beers that are not so be sure you are aware when ordering. ... Visited today and the avocado toast we shared was very delicious and we each enjoyed oat lattes. If they offered a dedicated gluten free beer, I would have rated them a 5 vs 4. I spoke with them and they are reviewing it. Again, good food., Wow! This place is amazing! It's a gluten free dedicated facility. They take gluten free seriously. I got the falafel and am drooling thinking about it. I wish I could eat here everyday., While visiting Denver, some friends of ours recommended Vital Root because my husband and I are both celiac and vegan. This place was perfect!! Both of our meals were tasty and satisfying, and honestly we wished we were staying in Denver long enough to try everything on the menu.... We got there around 1:30 on a Saturday and there was a long line. It took about 10 minutes to get through that line, but it was worth it. ... I highly recommend Vital Root to anyone who likes food, not just gluten free and vegan. ... We will be back on our next visit., Everything here - 100% - is made in a celiac-safe kitchen. The food is incredibly good - and it’s healthy, without tasting like cardboard., 100% gluten free restaurant, great food, never have been sick after eating here, Food is delicious and 100% GF. Everyone that I take to vital root loves it. Sunflower risotto is to die for., The entire menu is gf, most can be made vegan if it already isn’t. I had the Korean stir fry. I will be back, for sure, even though I am only in CO for a week., Vital Root is now completely GF [it wasn't when it first opened], and I've eaten here at least a dozen times without issue. The food overall is very, very good, although I do agree that some of the items are a little pricey compared with what you get. Standouts on the menu are definitely the pancakes - these are the BEST pancakes I've had in years, maybe even since pre-celiac days. The avocado toast sounds simple, but is filling and delicious, and the Root Down Benedict [brunch only] is very flavorful as well. I haven't had many of the desserts except the muffins, but they, along with the seed bread that they serve, are all made in-house., Everything is GF and it’s good too!, The staff was amazing! The food was ok, but not for the price., Pretty much everything on the menu is gluten free. There are only three items that you have to ask for them to be made GF. It's really tasty and healthy.

The salad, cookie, and chicken hot pocket were delicious. Will definitely return if I'm ever back in Denver - would love to try their burger!, Dedicated gluten free... Everything looked amazing and we were very happy with our meal. Staff was excellent, — All food is gluten free, some drinks may not be gluten-free, Amazing! I loved everything I ordered. So nice not to have to worry about CC. The ice cream sandwich makes me want to move to Denver., This is what they told me
When I contacted them: We are 100% gluten free kitchen - we are also 100% grain, refined sugar, soy, corn, peanut and legume free. We have one item on the menu with dairy and it can be removed. We have severe celiacs with incredible sensitivities and some say they feel safer at Just Be than their own home 😊 ... We are also the only Whole30 approved restaurant in the state of colorado if you’re familiar with that program which requires no gluten.... Good portions. Food taste delicious. Excellence service. They offer certified gluten free beer also. Happy hour from 3-6 pm. I had the Glow (egg roll), the crave (grass fed burger), and Riot (Buffalo chicken wrap)., — All food and drinks are gluten-free, This place is Amazing! I have Celiac and eat Keto....and every dish we had was wonderful!... We were only in town for a few days, but ordered twice...and both times were double orders...just so we could have leftovers!... Can’t wait to come back!, — All food and drinks are gluten-free, Probably the best GF restaurant in Denver.... 9.7/10, Probably the best place I’ve ever eaten since being diagnosed with Celiac. Great food and reasonable prices, Ridiculously delicious!!! Locally sourced with fresh natural ingredients. Real comfort food. Wait staff was stupendous! So thankful that my significant other and I chose this establishment. This isn't in any way a 5 star review because its cerified gf. It's a 5 star review because it is simple, delicious, nutritious, and heart warming food that will bring a smile to your face as you eat. We will be back. 01/06/2020, So good!! It’s amazing to be able to order anything off the menu. I’ve had the breakfast burrito and the biscuits and gravy. Both were delicious and the staff are accommodating about changing your order as well (ex. getting regular cheese instead of vegan cheese lol). The green chili is also amazing. I’m definitely going to come back again and again!, Who is leaving all these 5 star ratings? That’s what I wanna know. I understand it’s exciting to go to an all gluten free restaurant, I have celiac disease, I KNOW it’s nice to not worry. But when the food is this bad, it’s not even worth it. I’d rather eat a protein bar. ... All I ordered was the most basic dish on the menu. Eggs, sweet potato hash, bacon, and biscuits. What I got was a crime against humanity. The poached eggs were literally egg soup. I was forewarned that it would be runny. This wasn’t just “runny”, this was pure liquid and honestly a danger to even serve because it was so undercooked. Salmonella in a bowl, truly. The sweet potato hash was terrible. They shredded it like a skinned carrot, and burned the crap out of it. The biscuits were more like dog treats. Dense AF, I didn’t even give them more than a nibble’s try because I knew a full bite would make my TMJ sore. Even the bacon looked weird AF. ... I would normally feel bad for blasting a business so much, but I get really pissed off at this point by restaurants who are successful purely because they’re solely gluten free, even though their cooking skills are HORRIFIC. I’m just so annoyed that I paid $20 for this inedible food. ... So yeah, don’t go here. Just don’t., This place was not my family's cup of tea at all. Yes, it is celiac friendly and most items are dairy free, but they also do not use any sugar, which means that everything is ""sweetened"" with Stevia. Most of the staff had an attitude and, to top it all off, it is incredibly expensive. Three pancakes with a side of bacon cost us $52., Love this place! Dedicated GF restaurant with excellent, delicious food options! Call ahead or check website to make sure they are open -- we tried to go back one night and they were closed for a cooking class. Also, make sure you have your ID if you want an alcoholic drink. I forgot mine and they wouldn't serve this old lady!, It is kind of expensive, but it was probably the best meal I've had since going gluten free. I had the burrito with pork., The food was okay, ultra healthy. It was different, but I liked it. Had gf biscuits and gravy for the 1st time ever. Friendly service. It was pricey for what we got., Staff very knowledgeable and helpful with recommendations, mushroom biscuit dish was delicious, as were the homemade tortilla wraps and chipotle sauce, My burger was delicious. The sweet potato hash was lacking in flavor. ... I didn't get sick! Whoop!... It was very expensive., Like other people said, this place is great in theory but misses the mark. I really wanted to love it and there are so many gluten and dairy free options, but the food was terrible. The sweet potato hash was half raw half burned and totally inedible. My husband couldn’t eat the sausage. And not even my kid would eat those biscuit chunks., While it’s great to have a dedicated gluten free restaurant, the food was just not good. My daughter and I shared the baked pancakes and they were mushy and flavorless. The fruit compote was delicious, though. My husband had the breakfast burrito and he didn’t care much for it, and my son spit out the quesadilla. I had a vanilla latte as well that I kept adding sugar to, but never could get it right. We are from out of town so we won’t be back, but I wouldn’t come here again anyway, since no one in my family enjoyed it, especially not my celiac daughter., The food and atmosphere are great. I think it’s totally GF. GF beers. One of my favorite spots., Very safe but not very tasty and expensive. Other options near by for celiacs that have tastier options. That being said the burrito was the best of our party of 6 meals., I would eat here every day if i could. Great breakfast burrito, biscuits, and treats!!, 100% gluten free. Very impressive and great beverages., The food was excellent! Everything is GF, and there are plenty of DF options too. The sweet cream latte was to die for!, This place was AHHHH-MAZING!!! We had the granola with coconut milk...phenomenal; The Fulfilled Breakfast Burrito...out of this world; the Sweetness baked pancakes...unreal!!! We are visiting Denver but I sure wish we had something like JustBe in Florida!!!! This celiac was in HEAVEN!!!!, My husband and I ate here while in Denver. It was delicious. The food was very tasty, and my husband, who has celiac did not get sick which is basically the best. He also cannot have egg and they quickly offered us options on the menu he could have. We both had burgers, they had an egg free wrap I had mine in and he had it in lettuce. The burger was delicious!... He also had a coconut milk hot chocolate that was very thick and delicious!, It was amazing how the whole place was gluten free, and super healthy! Plus the food did t really taste gluten free. There was only one thing that my daughter had there that she didn’t like, and we don’t have to get that again. The variety and safeness of Just BE is so nice, and has been extremely helpful since my daughter was diagnosed with celiac., Nice restaurant I would call upscale fast casual. Staff was very friendly. Went for dinner on a Saturday night and it wasn’t too busy. I thought the coffee-rubbed steak was great, and my not-normally-gluten-free husband enjoyed the burrito and green chili. It was such a nice break not to have to worry about cross contamination. A bit pricey but we will be back!, Fresh ingredients. Nice fast casual spot with something for everyone. Large plate sizes will make you full walking away. Definitely knew their kitchen and zero fears of cross contamination. Their paleo tortillas were great when I had the burrito. Not a huge menu but everything looked edible on others tables too.... SLF had the French bread which was also good. Not amazing ... but good. Would definitely go back again., “Let your love send off so much positive energy that it shifts the vibrations in the room.” A framed quote that hung on the wall. Struck me as funny because when I sat down to eat the floor was vibrating and I could relax despite the calm interior. Hopefully it was just the construction happening across the street.... I initially wanted to order a sandwich served on a biscuit but they’ve got that on their dinner menu. They’ve got an open faced sandwich and some menu items that can be made into wraps but no lunch sandwiches. I tried the Faith an open faced chicken sandwich. The cashier told me it was a smaller portion size and it was. Wish it had been served with two pieces of bread. The amount of chicken salad could’ve handled it easily. ... I tried a basic brownie on my visit as well. It was larger than my sandwich and was a rich cake like brownie. Good but the piece of it that I ate didn’t sit to well with my tummy. Looking back I’m wondering if there was coffee in it.... Overall an interesting first visit. I’d try it again when I’m in the area., Our family ate lunch here while on vacation. Everyone was very happy with each of our food selections (chicken salad, burger, quesadilla, ‘Simplicity’ breakfast) - all plates were cleared! The best part was the piece of mind our 13-year-old daughter, who has Celiac, felt while ordering and eating here. We also enjoyed a chocolate chip cookie and brownie for dessert...wonderful!
Staff was lovely and sweet!, Really truly terrible food. I hate to post negative reviews about gluten free restaurants because I have celiac and am so appreciative of the experience of eating out. But wow, we had 6 different things and all were just disgusting. Thank you for existing (seriously!), but we won’t be back., Amazing food. I had the breakfast burrito with no eggs and extra veggies, with a coconut milk matcha latte. Definitely recommend!, Here's the deal, we were very excited to try this place, as our son is a celiac... But...... 1. $30 for two adults and a kid--for what we got, totally not worth it. My burrito was decent...tasty, but not for the $$$.
2. Atmosphere and staff were...kinda stark, and somewhat cold feeling--the kind of place that skinny people don't ever have any fun eat at. Plus they vacuumed twice while we were trying to eat dinner.
4. The burger that my wife had was nothing much to speak of at all. The bun was made with so much almond flour and that it was grainy, and dry and she couldn't actually taste the burger itself. The bun just fell apart.
5. MOST IMPORTANTLY: Our 4 year old son who is the celiac, began having reactions about 1.5 hours after eating there. He had the kids burger and carrot sticks (what ever happened to good ol' French fries?!) to me, the concern is that it's a gluten free facility, yet he almost immediately had a reaction.... FINAL THOUGHTS: If you are a celiac, proceed with caution. And if you know how to cook, make it at home. It'll be better and you'll save some cash. I promise I'm not a hater in all my reviews. This place is just severely lacking. ... However, if you don't want to cook, get the burrito. (not at all real green chile... Which grows in New Mexico, but tamatillo with pork) nonetheless, it was tasty., This was a great restaurant. Loved the food and for someone with celiac disease had the confidence that it was gluten free. The owner and staff were completely of service. We will be back again soon., If you are anywhere near this place you have to try it! The food, amazing and Paleo, the latte was sweetened with maple syrup, so good. Oh, and I will definitely be buying a brownie before I leave. The people are friendly and it's a sweet, airy place. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Denver!, One thing I really miss from being pre-diagnosis is being able to go out for an indulgent breakfast after a long night. This place lets me do that. My whole breakfast was delicious. Not only that, I got the falafel plate to go so I'd have something to eat at a wedding that evening, and it was the best choice ever. Imagine having to bring takeout to a really nice wedding, but then being pleasantly surprised by how good your meal is!, The entire menu is gluten-free, so there's nothing to worry about there. The good itself is pretty good - I had the chicken biscuit with potato salad. I loved the potato salad, and the biscuit was just ok. I will definitely come again., Great food and great peace of mind for a traveler. Came for lunch and breakfast., AMAZING food! Everything is GF! The staff is also very kind and helpful., Excellent food, and a very knowledgeable staff. Everything is gluten free and paleo, and multiple vegan options. Great variety, and dinner options are slated to be coming soon per their Facebook page!!!, Outstanding food and very knowledgeable staff!, I love this place! Delicious and safe., 100% Gluten free! I had the burrito without sausage and vegan green chili. It was fantastic, love the sweet potato hash. Non-Celiac husband loved it too. He had the burrito with pork green chili., We found this spot on a trip out to Denver. It is fabulous! Dedicated gluten free. Great variety. We’ve been here two days in a row. The chicken pot pie is a favorite., gluten free yes, but man was the chili salty... also ordered vegetarian chili and was served pork green chili, when asked the server they said it is vegetarian and those are chunks of mushrooms. not sure I'll be back, 100% gluten free and dairy free, had the pork chili with a huge gf tortilla! Super great sweets too they taste like the real deal. I love coming here, Great little restaurant! The pot pie was delicious and healthy. Parking is a bit limited, but I will definitely visit again., Wow such good pot pie the flavor is full and hearty but the crust is fantastic cuz isn’t soggy and can be dipped into the pie part. The setting inside is calming. Lavender latte is very light and smooth plus you can actually taste the lavender flavor., This is a fantastic little place. 100% gluten free and very tasty. A great find for celiacs. We had breakfast. The burrito and simplicity plate were very good. Almond flour tortillas are fantastic. Eggs, bacon, sausage, green chilli .. all good. Ask about the bullet coffees; a unique taste experience. The owners / managers are also very nice and the atmosphere is pleasant. We will return whenever we are in Denver., Dedicated GF and delicious. I had the breakfast burrito that comes on a almond based Paleo tortilla.

I appreciate their dedication, but the quality needs to be improved greatly.... I really wanted the products to taste better.

The other products I bought were dry and lacked flavor., — All food and drinks are gluten-free, — All food is gluten free, some drinks may not be gluten-free, Had the gluten free French toast. Toast was large with a berry cream cheese spread inside with fresh fruit. It was very good!, Everything was good and gluten free., I finally made it to Gluten Escape today and now I wonder what took me so freaking long! This place was awesome. It is a little underwhelming when you walk in, but don’t let that fool you. The food is amazing. We bought a variety of items and everything was delicious, even my gluten eating family found everything delicious. I had the best bagel I have ever eaten, including pre-Celiac gluten-y bagels. The vanilla donuts were wonderful and the toffee muffin was ridiculous. If you haven’t gone yet, go! But go early, to my understanding, they sell out quick. We were there at 8am and I got the last bagel., Brownie was so good, lots of choices!, Not bad but the texture bugs me -, They have some great options but from what we have tried we have mostly been disappointed with the textures or flavors. Fully dedicated GF kitchen and shop., They were very nice and helped me work through multiple allergies. Their bagels are wonderful!, Dedicated facility. FABULOUS texture to all their items. We visited a couple years ago and my husband still compares every bagel he tries to the ones at this bakery. So far no one has surpassed them., Brownies were amazing!! Didn’t like there biscuits., Worth the two hour drive and every penny. They were able to accommodate our corn free kiddo and can do even more with a special ahead of time order. Black Forest and Red Velvet cupcakes were wonderful. The best was the scones!, The blueberry muffins were UNBELIEVABLE. They didn’t look great, but holy cow. They also made a cake for my sons’ birthday and it was delicious. I was not very impressed with the scones or cinnamon rolls., Nice and safe, of course, but we were kind of underwhelmed by the taste/texture of the products. :-/, LOVE the Gluten Escape!! Great baked goods for any (or no) occasion. Love everything I've ever tried here and the folks who run it are so helpful and friendly, and I've never had an issue (I'm highly sensitive). Highly recommend them!, Love the selection and variety. We get several things and freeze them., My absolute life saver! I am a very sensitive celiac, so not getting sick when eating any where outside my house is a gift!, Can’t say enough good things about this bakery. They are amazing and food is totally safe and tasty!!!!, Not much seating, but delicious food. Dedicated gf and dairy free, so order everything with confidence. It is expensive, but gf food always is., Good variety. Perfectly clean facility. Kind of small portions for the price, not much savory foods or seating and pastries were dry, but service is super friendly., Dedicated GF! Visited on a trip to Denver. Cinnamon rolls and cupcakes are delicious! Bought bread to try later., Fantastic gluten free brownies and cupcakes!, they have a lot of gluten and dairy free items. i have gotten bread, cupcakes, cookies and even ranch dressing. everything is very good., The store has a lot of variety so picked several items. The pretzel buns were flavorful but incredibly dense and crumbley. The vanilla cupcake itself tasted more like corn bread with a gritty dense texture. The chocolate cookie sandwich was described to be like an Oreo which was kind of accurate. While it's amazing to have a dedicated GF bakery to choose from, all of the baked goods were lacking in some form., In Denver this is the only 100% GF bakery that has ever been worth going to. They are expensive and could do better but I'm just excited to have a safe place to get some carbs!! I love their bagels and scones and I used get my bread here. They seem to do better at savory. The sweets are hit or miss; the cakes are tasteless bean flour topped with sickening sweet, crystalized icing. But their cinnamon roll is perfect! I love the owner and the staff is very sweet! I hope they continue to grow and improve! I wish they used better eggs and dairy and expanded their meal choices to something worth eating. I work down the street; I'd be there everyday if they served a good GF sub!!, The cake pops are a new favorite! Really nice staff and lots of variety., love the variety. being gluten/dairy free, I was in heaven with options. great place to pick up a sweet treat!!, more like a negative 5... our bakery goods are hard as rocks (I prefer sift cupcakes and cookies), they are tiny, and EXPENSIVE. Drive to Colorado Springs And get fresh food, larger portions, for a decent price. ... And, just as an FYI to the owners, if you want to run an allergy friendly restaurant, you might consider having a few more nut free items. ... waste of time, waste of money... and, it is merely a bakery. When I read breakfast, I think bacon, eggs, hashbrowns, etc... OMG this is AWFUL. Not sure what they grind for flour, but my guess is dirty rocks. RUN from this place, Not impressed with the cake at all it is too dense and tastes like corn bread, Very knowledgeable and helpful. Everything is gluten free. Brownies are the best in town!! Even has all the stuff you need for Thanksgiving!, Just tasted their GF apple pie - Better than mom used to make. I didn't know that was possible!, I have been gluten free for quite some time and frequent GF bakeries. Was not impressed at all with the Blondie and brownie. No taste factor at all. Maybe other products such as breads and pastries are better but unfortunately I did not like the items I had., Food was not very good., What a great GF bakery with Celiac safe kitchen. Lots of options here ranging from cupcakes, cookies, 5280 award winning brownies, cakes, breads and grab and go items plus bagels, cinnamon rolls, donuts and more. ... I'm Celiac and have been going here last 2 years with no issues. Everything is delicious and made from scratch with only the best ingredients. If you're anywhere in Denver, its worth the trip!, Wonderful place, safe, friendly, KNOWLEDGEABLE., Wish the ingredients in the cakes/cupcakes were healthier. But loved the blueberry muffin at gnarly root!! They are good products!!, oh wow! these folks ROCK!! I just ate part of the rootbeer flavor cake and it is unbelievably DELICIOUS!! a yummy treat. you would never think it was gluten free. I wish I lived in the Denver area, this was so good! also the Mexican pecan cookie that I ate before driving away. It will take all my will power to not gobble up the other 2 generous size pieces of cake I purchased this morning., Don't pass this place up. Amazing. And staff is super helpful. Finally someplace to get lunch and dessert and no worries of cross contamation. Haven't had a gluten free pie in 5 yrs. can wait to bake it., AMAZING!!!! So excited to find a dedicated gf bakery. Wish they were located in my state. Baked fresh daily and free of tons of preservities. Non gluten free people would never taste the difference. Quality place and awesome customer service., EVERYTHING is gluten free!
I had a really yummy blondie and a turkey sandwich! This will be on my weekly rotation, We are from out of state and found the Gluten Escape located near our hotel. This place is 100% gluten free and the staff was very helpful. I have celiac disease and have been gf for 10 years. This bakery was so fun to walk into and find so many options in the fresh baked displays, the fridge, and the freezer. We bought a little of almost everything including pre made sandwiches to take on our road trip home., Excellent selection, service & quality. What a blessing!, Bakery items were delicious. Wish they offered made to order sandwiches. When we arrived they were sold out of premade sandwiches :(, So nice to have so many GF and DF options. Tried bars, cupcakes, scones, and bread. Favorites were the Caper Parsley Ciabatta (broiled with olive oil) and black forest brownie., Glorious!! Brownies, cookies, cupcakes. Repeat customer BEFORE I was diagnosed with celiac. Ironic, huh? It's delicious and the owners rock., Hoping the remodel/move is open soon! We have made three junkets from Lakewood to what my family calls, ""The GREAT GLUTEN ESCAPE!"" My wife has been a paleo-vegan for 2 1/2 years now and finding this place by accident, while at the Player's Bench hockey store, was a godsend. Each time we visited, we spent about $60 bucks. We got sweet treats, donuts, cupcakes and brownies. But what really impressed my wife were the quality and flavor of the non-sweet breads! ""Fantastic they were,"" said Yoda! The place was clean ans smelled great! On each of our three visits, a different staff person spent all the time we needed to answer our questions and make suggestions.

Might want to go when it's slow if you want to ask about menu options in more detail. ... Great spot for a date! Warm, cozy, elegant glassware and setting., They have a glass window all around the kitchen. By chance I sat right by the window and watched my pasta bolognese made. I was very impressed. It's not a dedicated kitchen. They don't have a dedicated menu. But I watched as they had the pan with my bolognese on a separate burner and cooked my pasta in a fresh pot of water. I watched as he carefully twisted up the noodles so they wouldn't touch the underside of the skillet. The plates were away from the other plates. Oh, and it was really great! I make a great bolognese and I would have swallowed it in one gulp if I could!! Now I went late so it wasn't too busy. We'll see if they are so cautious when they are slammed. I'll definitely be back though.","Mack,Laura,Yenz,Gayle",CO,1,0,2,80204

I had a gluten free soup and ended up in emergency with asphyxia..... 911 plus transportation and hospital bill was only $ 3000, Hot bar and salad bar for takeout items. There is a small bakery with some GF desserts. Grocery store is average-to-small size, but has the basics.... Average-to-small Whole Foods which has the expected staples. Bulk section and salad bar are nice., I stay away from the open bars for risk of cross contamination but their packaged foods is great and same with the food selection and flours for GF. Their Carmel sauce and pumpkin spice have gluten in it if you’re ordering from the coffee bar, but their soy milk is GF. I would ask for a cold drink over hot as the wand they use for oat milk is a risk for cross contamination as well., There are packaged, gluten-free options that are completely safe, but anything on the salad bar or hot bar is open the cross contamination. I usually do pretty well with the soup and salad but have been glutened on occasion from the hot bar., Buffet has ingredient list on food labels however, there is a lot of cross contamination. Have tried it a few times and always got sick from the buffet., Assortment of options. Personally, I do not trust any of the buffet style items so I got my Amy’s Mac and Cheese! I also got a few packaged desserts which were yummy. They have a microwave upstairs too for my frozen Mac and cheese!, Good for GF groceries. Would be nice if they specified whether their prepared foods are GF. Nice cooked stuff and salad bar but celiacs can’t touch. There are no labels on the salad bar stuff, I go here all the time and would know., A wide variety of GF grocery options!, If you're looking for gluten-free foods to cook with there are plenty of offerings. It's a grocery store after all. As far as prepared foods go though it's disappointing that a national ""health food"" store doesn't offer a small selection of made offsite ""fresh"" gluten-free baked goods. None of their prepared food items are made taking any allergy precautions., Plenty of standard gluten free items typical of Whole Foods. The best, however, is the variety of JPs gluten free baked goods they carry in a dedicated section of the bakery., Most of their hot food gives me a reaction, it is because they don’t use a dedicated gluten free kitchen., So many gluten free options. Service is great., Tons of options especially frozen products., Whole Foods is one of the Grocery stores that has the most gluten free stuff, desserts, crackers and more!🤩, Whole Foods has quality foods that are nearly impossible to find elsewhere., Lots of gf options. In chilled section, they have gf prepared meals., Very good selection of Gluten Free food. Nice fresh fruits and vegetables (many organic). Most outstanding feature is definitely their fish market; always fresh and top quality. Liquor department stocks Gluten Free beer (I highly recommend Lake Front Brewing) and cider. Prices are definitely high, but if you’re an Amazon Prime member they have significant discounts on selected items., I can always count on Whole Foods Market to have on their shelves the best quality gluten-free ingredients. I’ve been shopping at whole foods market since 1990!, Awesome selection of gluten free groceries, including multiple brands!, Huge store offering a variety of different gluten-free cereals and flour. Without oats and with gluten-free oats. I think celiacs find there a lot to have something to choose for breakfast., Soup and salad bar is marked very well for allergens. I have never got sick..., They have a good cracker and frozen foods selection especially for high-quality pasta and breaded items. I’m not impressed with its hot bar items. They have palatable frozen pastries and breads but they are a bit expensive and sometimes lack visual appeal because they are broken or have icicles. Once I bought a box of cookies and went to the car for a carb fest. I opened the box and every cookie was broken. I literally had nothing but crumbs and chocolate chips. I declined repurchase. This wasn’t an isolated incident. Whole Foods should be more careful with the shipping and handling of its gluten-free foods due to their composition and fragility.... Unfortunately, Whole foods could do a little better with eliminating unnecessary wheat/gluten products from some ready-made meals; for example, wheat berries or croutons in salads; use tamari instead of soy sauce in marinades., Grabbed a gluten free prepared meal on the way to a restaurant where I knew I couldn’t eat anything. The Pad Thai-esque dish with zucchini noodles was quite good, but pricey. They also have cake from By the Way Bakery., I shop here frequently. They have a ton of options! They also carry a selection of Cherbourg Cyprus desserts in the cold case., Hot bar has very limited gluten free options, and even fewer gluten free proteins. Salad/cold bar has a bit more but when I’m getting prepared food I prefer hot. I was going to get a questionable sushi roll and a bottle of GF soy sauce (they don’t offer GF) but decided to go a couple minutes down the street to Wegmans instead., I would expect a better selection for a place like Whole Foods. Overall, I don't find it worth my time, except for the ""Mybread"" Pita bread in the GF frozen section. Otherwise, I don't find their options to be all that much better than a regular grocery store. And there definitely isn't any pre-made food that is celiac safe if you're looking for a meal on the go., Kind of surprised that Whole Foods in-store restaurant can’t provide a list of allergen info of their menu items. The guy behind the counter had no clue what gluten free even meant. Wow, very disappointed., They have GF options for their restaurant area, sandwich bar, and sushi. The options are limited though and definitely no Celiac friendly. As a grocery store, they have several items that are GF and Celiac friendly., At most Whole Foods GF baked goods are in the freezer section....yup, bummer there is always very little in way of fresh GF baked stuff at WF’s, they did not have many gluten free options in the first place all i could get from the hot foods was mashed potatoes and then had a reaction directly after. definitely some cross contamination happening, one of the only supermarkets in New York where I could find a decent pack of glutenfree (factory) bread. You can also buy glutenfree muffins (freezer), cookies, flour etc., Some deserts are really good but everything gf there is so overpriced., While I don't typically grocery shop here, the chain as a whole is a go-to and a godsend while traveling if you need gluten free or any other allergy free items. The buffet always has options, even in smaller stores like this one, and allergens are marked., Before it was Amazon-owned, I shopped at this WF weekly for most of my groceries. Since then, they no longer carry many of the GF items I used to purchase, including cereals, crackers, snacks. They have substituted other cereals and snacks that have more sugar and less protein than I used to get. Fortunately there are other stores in the area that now carry more products that are GF, unlike when this store first opened., They used to be great about listing ingredients. It’s kind of hit and miss now. Lately the food seems like it is not very fresh. It seems like the food sits for a long time., Great choices but pretty spendy., Not much choices... store disposition was strange., I talked to a chef making taco items who was very rude and unwilling to discuss options with me. He told me that nothing in the made to order, pre-packaged, salad bar area was considered gluten free and said it as if it was absurd for me to not know that., Ate at the buffet/salad bar with no issues. I steer clear from items that are next to gluten items and therefore avoid CC issues. The store itself has a lot of GF items, especially in the frozen/refrigerated sections. Personal-sized cakes, breads, and cheesecakes!, Hot food bar is all labeled if dishes contain wheat, and they have a decent variety of store brand, cheaper gf options., Good selection of GF food at hot bar, you just have to be vigilant about reading all labels before you get something. And of course there are tons of gluten free options throughout the store., The staff was awesome! Francisca asked about my sensitivity and created a separate work station for me. She’s great! Can’t say enough good things, Good old Whole Foods. They carry plenty of delicious GF brands, even Beyond Bread breads. Great for stocking up your kitchen or for a picnic in the park, Love the salad & hot food bar at whole foods. All the items are marked with allergens & there’s very few items with gluten so comfortable with the cross contamination risk of a salad bar. Just just fill your take out box with roast meats, hot sides & salads, Great selection. They have gluten free ravioli in the fresh section and they are so good!, There are many opción gluten free but NO a lot, They make no effort to keep any prepared foods away from contamination such as placing crusty bread on top of the salad bar with crumbs falling everywhere, etc. Labeling looks promising but if you look closely they are often wrong, not matching up with actual food, many don't have allergens listed and use odd wording like graham instead of wheat. Overall, really frustrating that a supposedly healthy store makes zero effort to try and make their foods safe., Of all grocery stores, I find Whole Foods to be one of the most gluten free friendly. Tons of good options. Just make you read the labels!, Great selection of gluten free items!, No fresh gluten free items in the bakery. Very disappointing that the few gf items are frozen or bulk packaged.","LIDA SUSAN,Ria,Breanna,Tammy,Asok,gflindsey,GFREE,ashley,N.,Brian,Asok,Maureen,Vin,Nina W,Abbey,ksm,gf-Frank,Margie,Sophie,Martin,Upright Construction,Renee Matthewa,gfteacher20,Melissa,Kelsey,glutenfreecookie,Amy Marois,Justine,KKJ,hayley ,Renske,Ella,Abby,jill,kia,Krista4208,Matthew,Ashley,Lauren,Angela,Gretchen,AshleyA17,maya,Hayley,Nicole,Regi,sharon309,Julia,Liz,Carol",CO,20,5,36,80206

Not sure I’d trust at Celiac level., Excellent gluten free pizza!, They were very careful and voluntarily remade my pizza because they forgot to get a clean pizza cutter. The manager got out his corporate book to check the toppings for me. This location is fairly new and I waited to try it so they could get their routine down. The pizza looked and tasted good, unfortunately I did have a slight delayed reaction., Their recommendation is if you have celiac don't eat because of cross contamination. Everything is cooked in the same oven., GF cauliflower crust recommended! Friendly staff, suggested trying cauliflower crust. My first time ever trying cauliflower crust and I am SUCH a fan - crispy, tasty, and a bit of thickness to it which was nice. I love my thick crusts, however with seeking a gluten free option, I am so happy with this “new crust” experience. I would not have known the difference from the typical pizza crust if I did not know what crust I actually had. Also appreciated the variety of non-meat topping options.
Not the most well-lit location from the outside, but not that big of a deal. Overall extremely pleased with this experience., Very celiac friendly. And the food was delicious 😋, I was highly skeptical of their method of keeping the food gluten free safe for a celiac as they did not keep the pizza on its own pan when being thrown into the oven. They swept out a corner and then let that area cook for a while before putting the pizza in. I guess that is enough to turn the remaining residue into carbon because I surprisingly didn't get sick. However, the pizza wasn't that good. The gf pizza option at BJ's is much better- so I don't think I'd risk eating there again., Best gluten free and dairy free pizza I have ever had, there is no way to avoid cross contamination in this place. all ingredients have touched other pizzas in preparation. changing gloves for prep gives little protection. BEWARE!, One of the employees went out of their way to wash their hands, put on new gloves, and even open new sauce and cheese to add to my gluten free crust.
Then another employee took it off the peel (metal spatula) with the same peel she used to handle regular crusts and was going to put it on the same surface the other pizzas are cooked on. When I told her that wouldn't work, she said that's what they always do... which defeats the entire purpose of being careful about toppings.
I just left because it was obviously not safe., I stopped coming here because I was glutened very bad last time. No separate baking space and not safe for celiacs., They have GF crust. Asked if it was due to allergy or preference. Once shared it was allergy staffed changed gloves. Instead of using red sauce out of the normal area, they pulled out a squeeze bottle to avoid cross contamination., They have 2 gf crust options and will use closed sauce bottles and use liners /clean utensils and wipe out the oven if you tell them you have a gluten allergy. Plus it's delicious and not very expensive., On a time crunch while traveling. Ordered through app. Arrived and Let them know I ordered online. They checked the warmer and handed me the pizza. At the hotel, opened the pizza, wrong pizza. Not GF. Returned to the restaurant,The pizza I ordered, gone. Zero., Everyone working there was very nice and accommodated all of my cross contamination requests. They got new sauce and mozzarella from the back and cooked the pizza on parchment paper. And it tasted good! Make sure to ask them to take the proper precautions., This place is chock-full of cross-contamination. I am non-celiac gluten intolerant and I can get very sick from just a little bit. The staff were knowledgeable and to be fair they told me that the pizza goes straight into the oven after they clean it as much as possible. They changed gloves for me. They told me
They’d put the pizza in the pan. only detected a little bit of the discomfort I get with gluten, but it was there. I wouldn’t take a chance again here just because who knows if I could get more the next time. The food itself is friggin delicious and it’s a shame they can’t just have pans that the pie goes onto when it’s in the pizza oven. I think that would go a long way. California Pizza Kitchen is certified gluten free and nearby., Gluten free and cauliflower crust!!
They do have notices up that it's not celiac friendly because the pizzas are cooked on the same surface.
30 minutes later,no tummy ache!, Gluten free crust for any pizza option, They may have gluten free dough but they cook it in the same oven as the gluten full pizzas. Definitely cross contaminated., Pizza was just ok. Did not change gloves when preparing., This place was SO good. I have celiac and am very sensitive and the young man looked at me when I told him celiac and knew. He then changed his gloves. Told me my pizza would be cooked in the oven on paper to avoid CC. Got out a brand new sauce and cheese and pepperoni. Super happy and SUPER delicious. Love when a place is knowledgeable and confident!, The food was great. They had two options for GF crusts. They did have some protocols for preventing cross contamination (changed gloves and put my pizza on a paper to protect it from touching surfaces) but I wouldn't assume they were 100% effective., Not gluten friendly. They do have a gf crust but they said none of the meat toppings were gluten free. Shared oven. Flour everywhere. The staff was very helpful in making sure I knew what my options were because they did not want me to be sick. Did not eat here after finding out all the information., There is a gluten free crust available but the staff seemed unsure of how to prevent cross contamination. I am now anticipating a gluten-ache once it hits., The staff was knowledgeable help me select the crust I wanted the cauliflower and asked if I had any other allergies. My pizza was very good can’t wait to go back., Very considerate of a gluten allergen. Very pleased with my visit, They have 2 choices for gluten free crusts. One is called “gluten free” and the other is “cauliflower” which I have confirmed is also gluten free., They were very accommodating. Changed pans, opened fresh toppings to make gf pizza. They have both gf crust and cauliflower crust. Tasted great!, Great place they make gluten free pizzas, They have gluten-free crust and cauliflower crust. They won't put the pizza on a separate pan unless you ask them, and their sauces may touch gluten. When I ordered I told them about my situation, and one woman was pretty dismissive, said she just changed her gloves when I asked if she could change them, and said there are no pans left. She stuck the pizza right until the oven on top of layers of flour and crumbs. I told them I couldn't eat it, and a different woman was nice enough to make me another one and put it on a pan., The food was excellent. The pizza is heaven. They have separate sauce, oils, etc to a spud cross contamination. I got the GF dessert pizza and it was amazing., Everyone on the line is aware an allergy order is coming. Everyone who handled my pizza put on new gloves. Cauliflower crust was stored separately from other crusts. This location has a small oven they use just for gluten allergies. Oh, and they have Daiya cheese. Overall, a very good experience., Used to be really good. But their separate gluten free oven no longer works and you have to ask for a glove change and separate tray. The restaurant has gotten progressively more disgusting, especially the area where they prepare the pizzas. I used to frequent pieology when they first opened, but the last time I ate there I got sick, so no more., Very knowledgeable! They changed gloves and used new utensils! Will definitely be a go-to, Beware if you have celiac - I’ve been visiting this location since opening and over the past yr have been up all night sick. My guess is from pizza oven cross contamination while cooking . Even if the oven is swept not everyone is careful unless you watch everyone passing your item while and after cooking . Pretty bummed as I love Pieology, Definitely not celiac friendly, wish I'd read the reviews before I ate there - made me really sick., The staff seemed knowledgeable and took precautions to avoid cross contamination, but I still got sick., Cmon fellow reviewers there is no way this is celiac safe. The staff does not understand cross contamination at all. We lucked out and one of the guys working has a girlfriend with celiac and he was able to make us a pizza we left safe eating but there other two staff members had no clue and were mildly unpleasant. I would not come back and If you have celiac I would not eat here., This restaurant is ***Permanently closed!**** (3/21/19), I picked up a GF cauliflower crust pizza-first time Piology patron... I ate three pieces and LITERALLY called them just to say: thank you! I haven’t had pizza THAT stinkin good in YEARS! I ordered online, told them I had celiac, and am feeling no ill effects some time after. I’m genuinely impressed and will continue to order time and time again. Yummmmm... JUST MAKE SURE YOU ASK FOR THEM TO COOK YOUR PIZZA ON PARCHMENT PAPER IN THE OVEN, Cauliflower crust tasted great. But I won't be going back. Not safe for celiac. They didn't ask if it was allergy or preference. They didn't change their gloves. They dip the brushes back into the sauces. If you get marinara sauce it would be more safe. But since they use the same gloves and touch the non-gf pizza and touch the ingredients I won't be going back. I got sick, Celiac friendly pizza place. Very careful with cross contamination. My family has eaten here twice. My mom is more sensitive with cross contamination than I am and she also loved the pizza and was just fine afterwards., I ordered the gluten free crust and they asked if it was an allergy or preference. I told them allergy and they changed their gloves, used a separate pan with fresh paper and every person along the line asked if I wanted them to change gloves before handling my food. They even asked my husband who had a normal crust but asked for the dairy-free cheese. I was impressed how aware of allergies they seemed to be. Pizza tasted great!, I have celiac and we ate hear this evening. We had the cauliflower crust and it was excellent! The staff was very careful with making our pizza. Great place to go!!!!!, The crust is GF, but baked on same surface as all the regular pizzas. Cross contamination alert!, This was a great find. If you want healthy pizza, they have GF and Cauliflower Crust options and you get to pick toppings as they build it. They also have dairy free cheese, and great vegan options.We’ve taken several different groups of friends and everyone has loved it!, The corn flour used to dust the boards they prepare the pizza on is mixed with regular flour. You need to ask for a clean board, change of gloves and no dusting of the board. And they do not have a separate area to cook the pizzas so they are cooked on the same grate/area that the gluten pizzas are cooked. So if you are extremely sensitive, avoid this place., They put our gluten-free crust pizzas in the same oven as everyone else’s pizzas. They weren’t on a tray or anything. And I had to ask for a glove change. Also they put the numbers that were sitting on the counter that the flour crusts touch (and that they touch with the same gloves that they use to touch the flour crusts) on our pizza and couldn’t understand why that would be a problem. I’m extra vigilant when it comes to my celiac daughter’s food. She’s in so much pain if she’s glutened., Gluten free pizza is delicious as are the salads and you can customize to your taste, Not safe for celiacs. They reach their contaminated hands into toppings and touch the gluten pizzas. All toppings are cross contaminated. They cook the gf pizza in the same oven without anything under it so it cooks in the same spot a regular pizza was cooked. They don’t recommend this place for celiacs and i can see why. Unsafe., DO NOT EAT HERE if you have a wheat allergy or if you are celiac. I told them I have a wheat allergy and need minimized cross contamination. Guess what happened? They had a separate marinara sauce, then put toppings on and put my pizza IN THE OVEN DIRECTLY TOUCHING THE FLOUR AND OTHER WHEAT PIZZAS. I inquired to the manager, and he said that is their “process”. Eat at Pizza Rev or Mod Pizza, separate trays for us who can’t have CC!, Great pizza! Let them know to change gloves and get the sauce out of the bottle not to ladle on the sauce bc it touches the other pizza crusts.

My negative rating is to reflect the lack of care around gluten and allergies in general. In 20+ orders, they have literally never gotten it right. A typical order for us is a fresh avocado on corn (from their gluten free menu) or a Baja shrimp (grilled shrimp) on corn. Never once have I not had to go back inside the store. It's always reflected correctly on the receipt, but the kitchen just seems to see the title and ignore the large red letters on there that day gluten free,.or grilled versus fried.. ... I hate given a negative star rating, but no amount of pleading or explaining seems to avoid the need for us to meticulously go through the order when it's delivered and always, always have to go back inside and have them remake. ... Would be absolutely awesome if they could fix their process and I would immediately fix my review (which I've now moved from 5 stars in the beginning, one star at a time to one star).... But once they get it right, (and I'm pretty hungry by that point!), The tacos are great!, Tacos are really tasty, but a bit overpriced IMHO. $28.00 for 4 tacos and chips and guacamole., I mean, it’s possible, but they follow the alerts on the ticket really well so as long as the server writes it down... Killer tacos, great guac, although pretty damn spicy, chips are gf, never been sick here. Lots of options, probably 65? Percent of the menu can be gf, definitely try the Democrat taco and the fried avocado (unfried though) (it’s straight up just like huge chunks of avocado and beans but it’s freakin tasty)... Apparently their non-gf tacos are also really good, Takes “gluten allergy” precautions... Most tacos are gluten free as long as you get a corn tortilla. Note that chips are on the “gluten conscious” menu but are NOT celiac safe because they are made in a shared fryer, Best Mexican we have had while in Texas on this trip! Staff was great and this is during the Covid-19 situation. Restaurant is opened, also doing curbside and doordash. AMAZING FOOD!!!, Separate GF menu. Ordered it for pickup and they did mess up our order a little. Breakfast tacos were good. Would recommend., They have a big GF menu and are really helpful. Can’t go wrong with tacos!, It's been almost a year and a half since my last attempt at eating at this location. The ordering process seemed to work better and felt fine afterwards. I'll add a star each visit as long as there are no issues., I've had horrible experiences with the location near me in Houston. So. Very. Bad.... But I just had a great experience here in Waco. Considering the effort they put into the menu and checkout process I was satisfied and look forward to more visits in the 4 years to come if my child ends up attending Baylor., GF menu available. Staff able to mark as gluten allergy — At this location, it includes changing gloves and heating corn tortillas in foil or separate area. The chips are NOT GF as they are in a shared fryer, even though queso is listed in Gf menu. Love the independent taco., I have eaten here several times. They have always been knowledgeable on gf menu. My favorite is the crossroads taco and chips w/ queso., Ordered grilled shrimp tacos. Super sick after., I’ve tried eating here a few times, and every time I get sick. I’m Celiac, I order off of the gluten friendly menu, and talk to them about allergies. I suspect they don’t understand how to be safe in their kitchen., I’ve tried eating here a few times, and every time I get sick. I’m Celiac, I order off of the gluten friendly menu, and talk to them about allergies. I suspect they don’t understand how to be safe in their kitchen., As long as I order off the “gluten conscious menu” (uploaded below) then I have not had any issues so far. Just ask for the menu!, Staff member was really helpful. He warned their chips are made in shared fryer. Tacos with corn tortillas are great. Avoid the chips even though they are listed on the “gluten friendly” menu because of the shared fryer., As the chain does have gluten conscious menu, this location completely ignores it. When I placed my order, the cashier treated me as though I was a complete inconvenience. She then messed up my order on purpose and when I asked for it to be remade, she gave total sass. IF YOU FEEL LIKE TORCHY’S GO TO A DIFFERENT LOCATION., They have a ""gluten conscious"" menu. Be very careful about ordering from it, because some items are grilled on the GF menu are breaded on the regular menu, so if you don't specify, you will get breaded. For example, the shrimp in the Baja Shrimp taco, or the mushrooms in the Independent taco. And always ask for corn tortillas. ... Aside from that, the tacos are great, as are the queso, guacamole, and the street corn., I love their breakfast tacos on corn tortillas.
I normally do the pick 3 breakfast item taco which I do chorizo, potato and beans. I will caution that the chorizo is a little on the spicy side but taste so good. I’ve also had their barbacoa tacos with their roja salsa . Overall, great food and service., Not helpful when I asked about gluten free options. The “gluten friendly” menu was most of the same items on the main menu. I have Celiac, so I can’t just have it be “gluten friendly” and be safe. They didn’t have any details about the marinades or what I should really avoid. So I ended up ordering the salad. For $10 I could’ve bought 3 salad mixes at the grocery store and had 4 meals out of it. I got a few items for my husband and he didn’t find it all that good either. Your food is overpriced for what it is., THE BEST TACOS. They had gluten sensitive menu options (grilled instead of fried) so I was able to try a lot of their tacos. Eaten multiple times and haven’t gotten sick. They do fry their chips in the same fryer FYI!, Didn't feel good after some of the orders, felt fine other times., I have had the chips and queso several times, along with the Democrat taco with zero issues. A couple of years ago, I think I may have been glutened, but not any of the recent 5 times I’ve been there!, Hit or miss. Not knowledgeable staff. Cross contamination happens., They have a GF menu. The green chili taco was awesome!, Overpriced, and sued a much better taco joint in town for their name. Would rather eat at DGT who are Celiac friendly and have awesome large portions for realistic amounts of money! Personally haven’t gotten sick here but they never heat up the corn tortillas properly so....., Delicious and separate GF menu, but I did have a reaction. Not a big one, but there may have been some cross contamination., The gf menu is basically if you’re eating gf as a fad and not for intolerance and certainly not Celiac. For it to be gf, most of the sauces and some elements have to be altered but those changes aren’t visible when you get it, and the staff is so rushed they often make mistakes. You can probably safely eat the chips and quest but nothing else., They do have a gluten free menu, and if you do get what you ordered, the food is delicious. But despite ordering a gluten-free taco, they delivered it in a flour tortilla. Then they didn’t bring my whole meal that I ordered. Frustrating., Delicious tacos and sauces! Double layered the corn tortillas so the tacos don’t fall apart. Very flavorful tacos and beans!, Delicious food and lots of GF options. Staff is well-versed and can help you make safe choices, modifications where needed. ... Note about chips at this location: we were recently told that this Torchy’s does not always use a dedicated fryer for their chips!! Typically only on weekends when they are busy enough to use the extra one. We ask every time we go if the chips are fried separately., Had an entire gluten free menu, HOWEVER it’s not truly all gluten free. They use a shared fryer and don’t clarify that on the menu so be careful, This place is kind of hit or miss with being Celiac friendly. I definitely got a taco on a flour tortilla after talking with the girl who took my order about Celiac and gluten. The food is very good and cheap and filling, but it’s risky., Large gluten free menu. Staff seemed knowledgeable about my requirements. Chips have a dedicated fryer. All sauces are GF. Lots to choose from. Ate there last night. So far no effects., We ate two tacos. One with pork and one with brisket. I tried the tortilla and the meat in Nima. approved! Yummy, fast and cheap., Eat here frequently and have never been sick. Amazing tacos and the best queso I have ever had!, Sick for 2 days - wouldn’t try again., GF queso and chips are the bomb - they have GF tacos too - but I recommend trying to go off hours - I worry about CC when they are super swamped!, Do not go here for gluten free. Chips not guaranteed to be fried separate, tacos served with fried shrimp and fried mushrooms even when ordered carefully. They remade my dinner but I still got sick., Great Gluten free menu. Lots of menu choices, Have a gluten free menu and really good about knowing what ingredients need to be changed for safety. Have an allergy key when ordering to alert the kitchen., Great tacos and queso. Eat here all the time with no issues!, Went because I saw the GF “sensitive” menu and the other reviews but unfortunately my Nima gluten sensor detected gluten in my crossroads taco : ( this was at the one on Penn, Democrat tacos are delicious. I’ve never had an issue here or at any Torchy’s. Chips are safe and addictive., I wanted to give this restaurant 2 ratings. A one for their gf options but a 5 for quality and service. Their gluten conscious menu is NOT safe
They cook chips and tortilla on the same grill as flour. If you ask they will wrap it in foil on the grill with care
Also the chicken and beef have gluten
Good food but not super safe of gf friendly, always tell them severe gluten allergy and haven't had an issue. eaten here many times. celiac safe, The food is great but the I got very very sick the last time I ate here. I would not recommend this place to someone with celiac, Gluten sensitive menu. Delicious creative tacos. No reactions after eating there several times. Just wish they had homemade tortillas, other than that they were amazing.","Curt D,Matt,Jessica Anderson,Phillip,Kim,Meghan,Lily M.,Toni,WmDyer,Barb,Beth,Kirk,Kirk,Rebecca,Joanna,Alexa,Amy,Amy,sarah,Bob,Isis ,Janet,Sally,Liz,hanna,Cheyenne,Michelle,Stephanie,Mama Sweeta,Jairus,violet,Kate,rivory,Rachel,JenK,Austin,Courtney,Mark,Juliana,Kacie,JC Bulson,Tamara,Rene,Rodney,Lindsay,raspberry,Sara,JJ,Nicolas,Natalie ,Kelly,Maegan",CO,16,12,40,80203

Plus you can also go completely vegan and gluten free and still have an incredibly delicious and filling meal in moments! No growth hormones are used in the meat or dairy and now they are going GMO free! I eat here at least once a week and never feel bad about it!, Chipotle does not have a gluten free menu but instead has a list of gluten-containing ingredients to avoid. Cross-contamination is a concern, however, so let the person taking your order know that you are gluten free and if you need them to take the proper precautions.
From their website: ""If you avoid gluten, don't eat our flour tortillas. If you are highly sensitive to gluten and would like us to change our gloves, just let us know at the start of your order. You should be aware items containing corn, including corn tortillas (chips, soft corn, and crispy corn tortillas) and corn salsa, may have a small amount of gluten from potentially co-mingling with gluten-containing grains in the field.""... Chipotle is one of my ""go to"" places. I visited this location while in town and it was great., Traveling with celiac can be emotionally draining. I walked in and asked if they were familiar with what gluten is, no hesitation and was answered yes, gloves off, hands washed, new gloves on and started changing utensils. All the employees seemed to know how to handle things to keep me safe. A thank you to the employees there is not really enough as the same restaurant down the road looked at me like I was crazy when I asked about gluten free options. Great lunch with great service, can’t beat that!😊, They’re always willing to Change gloves and I feel safe eating there., I always get sick from this place. I mention my allergy and they change their gloves/ get separate spoons but they put the spoons in the same main containers.... their chips are NOT gluten free. They told me they were and I got very sick not educated at all apparently, Had no clue what gluten free is despite their menu offering a gluten free tortilla or taco shell., Every filling is gf.
The only thing not gf is the tortilla. Which is sad because real tortilla are made from corn not wheat.
Take the bowl then, Will wash hands, change gloves and use disposable scoopers if you inform them of your ""allergy."" Everything is gluten free except for the burrito wraps. The shredded cheese and lettuce is grabbed with their gloves so it would be cross contaminated. They will get fresh from the back if you ask. I just try to avoid going when it's busy as to not hold up the line. 🤷🏼, I asked them to change gloves because of an allergy to the tortilla. He immediately dropped the tortilla he was holding directly over top of the rice containers. Then washed his hands, changed gloves and grabbed the empty tortilla wrapper. He crumpled it up threw it away and then asked if I wanted a fresh tortilla and opened the new tortillas..... Need I say more?, i found a long strand of hair in my burrito and the rice was definitely undercooked, i could taste how hard some rice were. the meat was dry and too bland. everything was too salty and i couldnt even finish my food. TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!, They refused to serve me, citing cross-contamination. I even emailed their headquarters. They said no.... They refused to serve me, citing cross-contamination. I even emailed their headquarters. They said no.... They refused to serve me, citing cross-contamination. I even emailed their headquarters. They said no., Most things here are naturally gf, and staff will change gloves if asked.... Bowls, tacos, and salads can be gf, as are chips and even the queso, Many delicious gluten free options, I have been going to this location for years and have never had an issue with an employee not changing their gloves and wiping down the counter... Just say you have a gluten allergy and they will go change gloves!, We travel alot and give Chipotle for a quick easy meal. I am C but say gluten allergy for ease of explanation. They changed gloves. Were very helpful and kind., I got sick, not celiac friendly, Wipe down the counters/where they make the food, change gloves, utensils, and get fresh toppings specifically for allergies... quality and quantity is about the same as if someone wasn’t ordering gluten free... Manager trained a new worker right in front of me and he was extremely knowledgeable and careful about cross contamination., DO NOT GET CHEESE ! I repeat do not get cheese. Even if employees change gloves the cheese is still extremely contaminated. Watch the employees hands as they make someone's food. The first thing they do is touch a tortilla with their glove. The last thing they do is touch the cheese WITH THEIR GLOVE., Always have been knowledgeable and changed gloves and pulled food from fresh containers to avoid cross contamination when informed., Stopped by on our way to South Dakata. They did a great job with preparing my food safely!, When I was here and mentioned I had celiac, staff wiped everything down, took out old spoons from the containers, washed hands/changed gloves, then put got clean utensils and new lettuce. Didn’t even have to ask them to change gloves or get new utensils! Very well trained!, Chipotle ALWAYS gets it right! They wash hands, change gloves, switch utensils, & inform all of the staff down the line! They’re the best & ROCK SOLID for a celiac, especially during travel!... Corn based & fantastic! The only flour in the kitchen is the large burrito wraps, all else is GF!... Eating here is 100% safe, 100% of the time🔥, The only thing with gluten here is the tortillas. Get a bowl, and you won't have any problems at all. I've gone many times without even mentioning my allergy with no problems at all., Most of the time I don’t even have to explain. I just say that I have celiac and they change their gloves and get clean spoons. And they don’t touch the serving spoon to anyone’s food.... The only thing that has gluten is the tortilla.... It’s my go to place for lunch or dinner, Love this place! It’s my favorite fast food place to go to because the only thing that isn’t gf is their flour tortillas., No precautions taken at all. If you wait in line and watch them, it’s basically gluten city. Asking them to change gloves (or put some on because they often don’t wear any) is irrelevant because they touch the flour tortillas with all utensils and allow everything to contact other items. Frequently they’ll overfill and put an ingredient BACK in the tray. So there’s massive x-contamination. DANGER!, They have gloves on and a plexiglass in front of the food and during this crisis they have masks on at all times... You can have a bowl with the same toppings as a burrito, This is seriously the most conscientious Chipotle I have ever eaten in. I live nearby and eat here about once a month. They change all the spoons, wipe down the counter and get out fresh lettuce for me. I have never gotten sick at this location. They are the best. Just let them know before you order and they will take care of you. I am not celiac but very sensitive., They did not change their gloves. Told me they ran out of separate toppings. Same work space... It May have just been this location because usually all chipotles are a safer option, but they told me they ran out of toppings and just threw what they could in my bowel. The same toppings that were touched by flour tortillas and I’m sure there was cross contamination! Truly disappointing! 1 Star, Staff didn’t know what to do . Needed to be asked to put in clean gloves and reminded to use clean utensils. The last time I went to this location I thought they were knowledgeable and did a nice job. Today’s crew had not been trained properly. Also their COVID-19 precautions were very lax. Masks worn improperly or around their necks. Probably won’t be back.... Their COVID-19 precautions were very lax. Masks worn improperly or around their necks. Probably won’t be back., Honestly, I’ve gotten sick eating here twice mostly because I do not think the staff cared about my allergy. Only at a few bites and got sick quick. I ordered according to their online menu that was GF, They do wipe down the counters and change their gloves after washing their hands. They take out the condiments straight from the bag below the buffet style service., The staff was polite and changed gloves when I ordered my rice bowl. However, I noticed as they made someone else's burrito that the serving spoons touched the flour shell and then they put the spoon back in the container. I got extremely sick and suspect it was from cross contamination on the spoons., I have a very sensitive gluten intolerance and every time I try their food I get my symptoms... Only on their website/ nutrition info you can find gluten free information, They are very nice and will always change gloves when asked. I have never in my life gotten sick, and I have eaten here a lot.... If you eat here you cannot get a burrito or a taco, but you can get a bowl! The bowls have all the same stuff that the burritos and tacos have, except for the shell/wrap/tortilla. Everything they put inside the food is gluten free. The chips are also all gluten-free corn chips., They do use flour wraps. But if you tell the worker you are gluten free they will change their gloves, change the spoons, and should also change the lettuce and cheese containers since they stick their hands in with the gluten gloves... Very yummy of course. Gone here for years., Kudos to the manager who upon learning that one of the meals was for a celiac (gluten free) person stepped in and with GREAT personal and serving care assured that there was no cross contamination. 5 Stars for the extraordinary care that was exercised, Workers will change gloves, wash hands, wipe down counter, and bag meals separately. They are compliant and very kind!... Everything at Chipotle is gluten free except the tortillas., Everything at Chipotle is gluten free except the flour tortillas. I LOVE having so many choices!!!, They’ve definitely gone downhill. Last time I got their food, it wasn’t very good (dry chicken, missing ingredients) and I was sick afterwards for several days. Can no longer recommend, I love chipotle! They never disappoint, they always give you a good amount of food. I usually get a bowl and most items on their menu are gluten free and celiac safe., The folks working here were super conscientious about changing gloves, wiping the counter, and using new tongs when I told them of my gluten allergy. The food was great and I feel great!, Cross contamination is high if they don’t change gloves or use fresh utensils. Not Celiac safe. Informed them of this but my meal had evidence of other salsas and meat, so it appears utensils were not changed even though requested. Stopped eating as soon as saw this but still having gluten reaction, Will change gloves, wash hands, and get separate cheese and lettuce if you ask. It really depends on the person you get when you order though. I’ve had both really good and really bad experiences. Most of the time the workers are very friendly but I’ve had a few of the workers get visibly irritated when I tell them I have celiacs.... The food is always good. I love getting the rice bowls and they’re fantastic.... I would give it 5 starts if some of the employees weren’t so rude. A few get visibly upset when they have to wash their hands and change their gloves. It’s just an unsettling feeling when they’re making your food and it’s honestly just really rude., Delicious clean ingredients and they’ll change their gloves and spoons if you tell them you’re gluten free., I've eaten at other chipotles and been ok, but I'm having a major wheat reaction this morning. It's possible it's one of my other sensitivities, but none of them give me this reaction that I know of. ... When I ordered, I told the server about my restrictions. He didn't change his gloves like I've seen at other franchises, nor replace the serving utensils. Like an idiot, I didn't ask him to because I didn't anticipate it being a big deal. And I didn't want to make his life harder during the pandemic. But...

Had gluten free options and also almond milk option. A little pricey as they do charge extra for almond milk and gluten free bread. Staff was very knowledgeable and friendly., Great pancakes, Celiac friendly. Staff very knowledgeable and take extra precautions., Best gluten free pancakes ever! I go every time I am in Denver. They are very knowledgeable about cross contamination. Have never gotten sick eating there., Food is delicious and the staff was knowledgeable! I didn’t get sick and will definitely go back next time I’m in Denver., Okay so this places food is amazing!! I loved their gluten free pancakes and so did my brother they also had really good breakfast tacos according to my mom and the non gluten free things where good too! (Again according to family members) they do a nice job with keeping things safe and they mark things well the only issue I had is it was kinda difficult to order and It was difficult to order but it might just be because I’m quiet but it was not easy but I highly recommend here and it was worth the drive, They have gluten free bread options and can prepare some of the menu items GF when requested. They also have GF pancakes. The food is very good. I didn't have any problems eating there., The food is great and they definitely have ""gluten free"" options, but my son (who is a celiac) got sick off of the pancakes., This was a wonderful find... amazing food, lots of GFA options... organic quinoa was awesome!!!, Amazing pancakes and english muffins!, My celiac daughter has eaten here multiple times without any issue. We love it! GF pancakes are delicious!, I visited to try the gf pancakes, but then saw they had huevos rancheros! It was amazing. The gf English muffin was also delicious. I’m a celiac and I didn’t get sick., Staff was knowledgeable about gf options, took me seriously. Food was great for my partner (who ate gf) but my omelette was just ok, bacon was very crispy., Informed server of celiac and was informed cross contamination possible. GF pancakes are cooked on the same griddle and at the same time as regular pancakes. Not only that, they use the same spatchula to flip the pancakes. Should of asked about that prior to getting sick. Not celiac friendly., Sitting at doctor and just told rash is due to Gluten exposure. Service and food was yummy but not worth being glutened, Great options. Suggest the pancakes! Gluten free English muffin isn't bad either., Delicious breakfast, delicious GF pancakes. My Celiac daughter was happy, with no issues after eating. They also have GF English muffins. My family enjoyed both GF and non GF food. Very nice atmosphere and friendly service., I highly recommend this place if you have food allergies especially gluten. They have many GF options, including gluten-free English muffins and pancakes. They’ll also work with you if you have other issues like dairy as I do. Many restaurants like First Watch have cheese on all dishes and make it very difficult to order but not so here. ...  The food is also delicious, with local ingredients, and it’s a very nice ambience. One of my favorite restaurants to go to as someone with celiac disease I highly encourage anyone to check it out., Lots of GF options but do mention if you have celiac. They recommended I stay away from the pancakes and hash browns. The pancakes are made on a shared grill. The hash browns are okay (made on a separate grill) but are in close vicinity to non-GF food. Probably would have been fine but played it safe and got the breakfast tacos instead as recommended. Charlie was our server and super knowledgeable! He made sure the staff knew to take extra precautions for celiac. Definitely will come back!, * new location * I was super nervous to come here as I know there’s gluten present in their kitchen. I told the server I had celiac and just ordered the GF English muffin (delish), a fried egg & OJ. She talked to the cooks who said it’s pretty easy to keep from cross contamination unless it’s one of the “GF” pancakes. So I was sure to avoid those. Thankfully I didn’t get sick & maybe I’ll try more next time!, Great food & tons of GF options. They are knowledgeable and careful with GF food., Best GF pancakes ever! Can choose from a flight of 3. Love the cinnamon swirl, Hawaiian and blueberry!, They have a great symbol system for all kinds of dietary restrictions, and everything is delicious, The best gluten free pancakes ever!

The green apple, chicken, fennel sausage was wonderful and the hash browns were tasty as well. Our server, Zachary, was amazing, very patient and knew a lot about food allergies. He went back to the kitchen to ask about ingredients in items multiple times. The fact that they source so many of their items locally added to the quality and freshness of the food., The best gluten free pancakes! Love the blueberry streusel!! Staff are awesome as well. I eat here every time I am in Denver ❤, An incredible find! Super happy with the variaty of very tasty gf pancakes and I didn't have a reaction.

The food itself was ok, pancakes were gummy and not a ton of choices., Lots of gluten free options! Service is slow., Many gluten free options. I’ve eaten here many times this past year and the staff have always been knowledgeable about celiac as has the kitchen. They even have gluten free English muffins. Great food and great for gluten free, OMG. The GF Colorado blueberry streusel pancakes were easily the best pancakes I've ever had in my entire life, gluten free or otherwise., The food was good, but there was also some cross-contamination. We told the waiter about being Celiac and he said they had a separate prep area and were knowledgable, but cross-contamination occurred for sure! Pancakes are NOT safe here., Gluten free options are good, liked the cinnamon pancakes. Recommend to anyone with celiac, really good service and really good gluten free food. Didn’t get cross contaminated and they are very aware with food allergies and people with celiac, There is a gluten free menu but all items are cooked on shared space on the griddle. They will not cook separate for you., I stopped here while going through. I didn't experience any issues with the food I received., Lots of choices! They have great pancakes, and unlike some places that just put stuff on top of the pancakes, they really make them. My daughter had cinnamon swirl pancakes that were beautiful and tasted like a cinnamon roll. I had pineapple pancakes and the loaded hash browns. Everything was super yummy, portions were large, and wait staff was very accommodating., They have a lot of gluten free items upon request. The pancakes are AMAZING and huge..., I ordered gluten free pancakes, and was very explicit about needing them to be gluten free. The server even repeated the order back to me. However, after eating 2 pancakes, the check came and I was not charged for gluten free. Turns out the pancakes were not gluten free. The manager was apologetic, and gave me the food (which I can't eat) for free. He also told me to let him know if I have a severe reaction. ... I have a very bad wheat allergy, and have gone to the ER before from it. Luckily I took a 24 hour antihistamine before going to the restaurant (I always take one before going out to eat). I also took a benadryl right after I found out.... I will not be going back to this restaurant, and do not recommend it for anyone with celiac or a food allergy. I would give 0 stars if I could., I love love love Over Easy but every time I get the Pancakes I have a reaction immediately. They do have other GF options I just wouldn’t recommend the pancakes., Love this place! Delicious gluten free breakfast options., Best gluten free pancakes. Have to try the Hawaiian, cinnamon and the blueberry. Beth was knowledgeable & very attentive. Had a great experience.

Very knowledgeable., This place is friendly and helpful. The waitress, Beth, was very accommodating. We had the corned we'd hash and eggs Benedict, both were delicious. Best GF English muffin I have ever tasted! ... They also have GF pancakes., This place is the bomb, they have any pancakes you want. They are GF friendly and they have the GF on the menu. Makes it easier to order. I hate when I have to ask for a GF menu. it's usually a card, ugh!! I have eaten here and never had a reaction. Great staff as well., I have not eaten at this location. Based on my experience at the downtown location, I would assume this location is not celiac friendly. It has a nice breakfast menu and is a good option for people without dietary restrictions., My non celiac friends love going here. I have had a negative reaction (celiac) to the gluten free options 3 out of the 5 times I ate here. Each time I spoke to the manger to be sure the order I placed was optimally gluten free. I can not eat at Over Easy., Wonderful delicious celiac friendly food!!, My daughter and I both have Celiac. They had several gluten free options and designated area for prep and cooking.
The food was average, a little disappointed.
But we didn't get sick, so that's awesome!

They mark every plate and even ring up the gluten free on a separate ticket. However, even some things can slip through a really great system. I did end up with a tempura roll with my gluten frees by mistake and spotted it. The manager was very apologetic, comped the roll and brought me the correct one. ... I have a feeling this is incredibly rare for a place so conscious and I mention it mainly just to say – if this happens to you, no, the tempura isn’t GF. Other than that the food was great, happy hour was amazing and I did not get sick., Hapa had a variety of GF sushi delights.

The servers don't have any training in accommodating Celiac disease., Great food and felt comfortable as a celiac. Also soy free was accommodated, Great food and great job with GF.

Had the Healthy Club salad and Healthy Nut smoothie., I asked what the most popular bowl was and ordered that. The Mexicali bowl hit the spot just right with the seasonal shamrock shake (I didn’t feel guilty drinking it). Don’t let the menu throw you off, they listed glutened items with a G!, Very friendly staff and super yummy food! Lots of g free options. I love it’, ""All of our salads, almost all of our drinks (the ones that do not contain our house-made cocoa malt powder), and bowls are gluten-free. If gluten-free catering is what you are looking for, we can help with large, family-style bowls of our best gluten-free menu items.
We hate doing this since they’re some of our favorite items, but our Protein Bar-ritos cannot be made gluten-free as our wraps are made with whole wheat. From our breakfast menu, avoid our Oatmeal Bowls, as well as breakfast bar-ritos.""... Staff accommodating to cross contamination precautions. Had egg/turkey bacon bowl and the health nut smoothie. Very energizing!, Clearly labeled GF options and riced cauliflower sub for rice!, as a celiac this is my go to if I need a quick, safe option never once felt sick after, Amazing place! Almost entire menu is GF and they take the proper steps to not cross contaminate. Very nutritious salads, bowls, and breakfast. Plenty of vegan options too!, Made me sick, but the food was really good., Awesome and filling lunch! I had the Spinach & Pesto bowl with cauliflower rice. They said they changed gloves and seemed well-informed about allergies., Many of the menu items are listed as gluten free but the sauces contain gluten. For instance, the beyond meat spicy Korean dish is listed as gluten free but the spicy Korean sauce is known to contain gluten. I've contacted corporate about this but of course nothing was done since this was a nationwide mistake and probably many people have gotten sick. I'm very thankful that a knowledgeable employee stopped me from ordering this dish as I didn't know I apparently need to cross check every ingredient. I'm too scared to eat at any of these locations again. I don't believe I got sick, but it's irresponsible of the chain for touting gluten free foods when they're clearly not capable of keeping people safe. I worry about contamination and employee training., Great breakfast and protein shaked, I’ve come here for lunch half a dozen times and had no issues. Just make sure to tell them you have celiac disease and are very allergic to gluten. All of their bread ingredients are at the end of the line so there is reduced chance of cross contamination.... The food all tastes great. Plenty of gluten free options., Yum yum yum yum. That says it all. One of the best lunches I’ve had in a long time. My wife and I went here today for lunch - she got the Steakhouse Ranch and I got the Mexicali. The bowl was wonderful,, great flavors, a lot of food, and then even post the carbs. ... I could eat here daily and be happy. I’d highly recommend others check this place out. ... I did NOT get sick and didn’t have any adverse affects., Good food. Didn’t get sick here but also the service wasn’t completely reassuring—I had to explain what cross contact meant. Definitely thought I was gonna have to be sick, but everything turned out ok. I’d come here again, just be cautious., Staff very clear about allergens., Good salads and bowls! My wife and I had lunch here. She is GF and I eat vegan. We both had salads we loved and I had a vegan chili bowl. My wife’s GF Caesar can with Parmesan “croutons”., I love the Mexicali bowl! They mark things on their menu that do have gluten. I think they’re careful about cross contamination- I’ve eaten there a few times now., The menu indicates what contains gluten, and much of that refers to the wrap. Contents of wraps can be served in a bowl and thus gluten-free. I told the cashier I have Celiacs and he noted it on my order and instructed the entire line to change their gloves. This menu features hearty, healthy, and flavorful food - a good alternative to the sad salads celiacs get stuck with at many places., Be aware certain menu items are not marked with a “G” contains gluten, that actually have gluten. For example, the chicken chili contains gluten but is not designated as such. The kids menu does not have one food item that is GF., Many things on their memo are said to be gluten free or not contain gluten but if you ask the staff they say it will. completely misleading., Almost all items are safe. Take great care of Celiacs!!!, I had the spinach and quinoa basil pesto bowl and it was so good!! Almost everything on the menu is naturally gluten free. It's a great option for those who are looking for a quick healthy meal, I definitely will be back soon, Got super sick from this place. Everything is well marked and I told them about my allergy and they clearly didn't take it seriously. Might just be this location because I know people who have eaten at the other ones and been fine but this was BAD!, inside hospital complex in case your gps is not clear. had bbq protein bowl with no issues. vegetarian options., Excellent food. Good flavor, and quick service. Good prices for healthy and gluten free food. Highly recommended., Good food. Good service., I had the Thai Coconut Curry bowl and it was delicious! So happy to find a quick spot to grab a gluten free bite!, Great option near the museums for a quick lunch. Our group enjoyed the quinoa bowls. My child with celiac had no problems. Will return., Protein bar clearly labels everything that's gluten free and vegan on their menu. The quinoa bowls and salads are all gluten free and delicious. They also have a few gluten free power scramble bowls during breakfast. Be careful with the signature drinks. The powder they use in some of them contains malt., So wonderful and a healthy meal option, great service and the owner was educated and respectful of our celiac needs. Great place!, Very good and seem to understand GF and cross contamination. Expensive but good., Loveeeeee their vegan protein power bowl and such a nice change of pace to eat quinoa instead of white rice. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because their hours are lame and I always seem to miss them., Eat here often. Love the quinoa bowl with pesto and spinach!, This place is amazing. The food is great and staff is friendly, -Majority of menu is gluten free and dairy free -lots of options and staff know what is up. I'm very sensitive and will update if I get sick.... Food is delicious, Health, GF food! Salads, quinoa bars, shakes and more!, Yum! GF items denoted on menu. Wish we had these where I live!, Great atmosphere. Food tastes good, I eat at Protein Bar everyday for lunch and frequently breakfast as well. It is a great place for a healthy-conscious person to eat. A lot of their menu is quinoa or salad based. They also offer raw juices and don't serve any pop! Your body will thank you for eating at Protein Bar., This place is great!! They have wraps, salads, and bowls, and a lot of them feature quinoa. A lot of items, including all of the quinoa bowls, are naturally gluten-free. Their menu features a little GF icon next to any items that are gluten-free.

Had a fantastic burger. Fries are NOT cooked in a dedicated fryer, but staff knows and shared this info. Will be back!, First and foremost this gluten friendly menu isn’t celiac safe.

Had the Pineapple Express burger, no chips, double the simple salad, and Gf chocolate chip cookie. Would be 5 stars but they were having a few issues with being out of menu items., I have been here a couple of times and eaten different items. I always specify that I have Celiac and they are extra careful about cross-contamination and the food is great!, Ordered hummus marked gluten free and chicken bites marked gluten free. Started to feel bad, I asked again to confirm if they are gluten free. She said yes they have no gluten in them but are made in a shared fryer 😫 containing gluten ingredients. I usually ask this before ordering but was overly confident in the abundance of gluten free items on the menu that were fried, I was never at a place that marked them GF and used the same fryer. Lesson learned, Tried it out because of reviews of other chains and I was not disappointed! Waitress was very aware of celiac, and the table next to me was also celiac (always a good sign). Plenty of gluten free options and delicious food. Didn’t get sick and will be back!!, Almost everything on the menu is GF! The wait staff was super knowledgeable and made sure to make notes when ordering. They also have a gf menu for kids! It was so nice to have a GF family dinner out., One of my new favorite restaurants!! Lucky to have Illinois' only location near me!... Favorites: Chicken bites (buffalo, Sriracha, salt n pepper)--all awesome; Sriracha Shrimp Bowl-spectacular; Cuban-nice change of pace!; Fries are good.... Mediocre: Smashers (fingerling potatoes--very greasy) Would love it if they introduced something with more crispiness--like loaded waffle fries or something.... Burger was awesome, now they switched from bun to bread and the bread has a rice flour ""taste"" that's off-putting.... I'm very sensitive to gluten and trust this place., Many gluten free items, very tasty!, Guac, burgees, impossible burger, veggie tacos, and siracha shrimp bowl all good. Salmon burger was disgusting. Great gluten options, This is my go to restaurant!!! We came on opening day and have come here very frequently since. I have never gotten sick here!

Almost all items can be made GF. They also make the most amazing chocolate chip cookies!, Staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable. We were, however, very disappointed when we were told on our last visit that the menu changed with an addition of fried fish, which meant the fryers were no longer dedicated GF. What a bummer! My 10 year old was pretty disappointed that he couldn’t eat any of the food from the fryer. This was one of the only really safe places for Celiacs in town., Some of the best gluten free options I’ve seen out there since finding out I had celiac 10 years ago! Fried calamari used to be my favorite and I could never have it, but Next Door offers the only gluten free calamari I’ve ever come across and it’s fantastic!

Celiac makes it hard to have fun finding new restaurants sometimes, but Next Door changed that for me and offers a really fun experience of trying new gluten free items you usually can’t find anywhere else!, We’ve been here twice and the staff is knowledgeable, they have clear information on what can be made GF. Tested it in Nima and no gluten was found 🎉👌🏼. Food is delicious too which is definitely a plus., Very impressed! We will be back!, Food was so good and the staff was very knowledgeable! Lots of choices, I have had a good experience there each time. One of my new go-to's!, There are a ton of options here. Most items, except for the fish and chips are GF or can be made GF. They have protocols in place to handle Celiac orders. I’ve been several times without issues., We told the server I was celiac and my daughter is gluten intolerant. He seemed very educated. Then our daughter was brought a regular grilled cheese. They corrected it. Then brought a different desert than we ordered. Supposedly gluten free.

The server explained how our GF meals would be prepared vs the gluten containing ones. The burgers were amazing!

Rating changed from five to three stars and hoping to have a reason to change it back.
We plan to come back. Farm to table local sourcing approach with games available for kids and adult to play while waiting for food., There was a wide assortment of Gluten Free options that all actually sounded good and were still healthy. They couldn’t guarantee gluten free fries from the frier but they had plenty of other choices. The food had great flavor and did not make either of my daughter and I sick. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about Gluten Free options. When he asked if we were sharing food, the cooks split our burger and meal completely. Great place, very nice environment! Would recommend., There are many GF options. I had the chicken sandwich which was excellent! I’ll definitely go back!!, Shared frier.

The manager is a celiac and she took time to talk to us and let us know everything we could eat, which was well over 95% of the menu. The also offered to make new batches of food from the salad bar in case we were concerned about cross contamination! CANNOT RECOMMEND HIGHLY ENOUGH!, My family loves eating here! With celiac I feel safe and have tons of options. Pretty much all the meat is gf, and the buffet and salad bar are all labeled. I’ve been here plenty of times and they do an amazing job., Great selection of gluten free on the salad bar and all the meats that come around are gluten free. The Brazilian bread is also gluten free. Lunch / brunch meal and salad bar only dining options are both very reasonably priced if you are looking for a cheaper option. The full meal dinner is definitely worth the cost and a fun experience., I have eaten here several times and always had a great experience. All meats are GF. Items on the salad bar and hot food buffet are clearly marked. Brazilian Steakhouses are a fun dining experience., My wife is Celiac and we love Rodizio Grill. She loves the GF Cheese Bread Rodizio has, and the fact that all the meats are GF. They even have a GF chocolate torte that’s her favorite. And almost the entire salad bar (only a couple bread items kept at one end, and a pasta dish). She’s never been sick from eating here and we’ve been many times. Love it!, A LOT of gf options. Delicious food. Go hungry because it’s all you can eat., We had a waiter who was knowledgeable about gluten allergies (and had actually only been there two weeks so that tells you how much they educate their staff). Spoke with the manager at the end of our experience who reiterated how important the control of cross contamination was to him so that it was a safe place to eat. The whole staff seemed VERY knowledgeable about celiac and gluten intolerance. I felt very safe eating here and the food was delicious! Especially the cheese “bread” that’s gluten free!!! WIN!!, Food was great! The meats were all GF and at the salad bar everything was clearly labeled. I was so happy when I also was able to eat the cheese bread that comes with the meal! They have a paper menu at the front counter that give a a good description of each food and lists if GF or not, it was really helpful., In addition to celiac I have several food allergies. They gave me a laminated allergen sheet that had most food items listed. While the salad bar was a no go most of the meats were safe for me to eat. It tasted great!, This was an amazing first visit. Everything was labeled, the servers were very knowledgeable. It was incredible!, 100% pure gluten-free Meat Sweats
There are only 2 items in the entire restaurant that aren’t GF and they are located at the salad bar. Eat the meat and you’ll be fine., Everything was clearly marked gf but gf was right next to the pasta...cross contamination. I spent the last 24 hrs with terrible pains., Gluten free menu and amazing Brazilian food!, I have eaten here many times with no reaction. I am a Celiac with Crohn's, so I have to be extra cautious about what I eat. Food is delicious every time I go., Yummy meats and sides. I made sure to discuss my allergy with the manager. Some items in salad bar are not GF, so I made sure not to eat items adjacent. UPDATE: feeling tired and wiped out a couple days later. Might have been cross contaminated., Fantastic experience! Almost everything is gluten free! Will definitely be returning!, My wife has celiacs and we love the fact that nearly everything here is GF - literally all the meats and almost all the salads. She LOVES the GF cheese bread!! And GF chocolate torte too. Was awesome., This place has plenty of options for gluten free living. Was very impressed with the large selection of GF options. Im not celiac but GF due to medical condition. I would reccomend calling and ask about GF kitchen and food handling, for cross contamination. Other than that I was able to eat and enjoy my dining at this place., Great meats, salad bar is labeled clearly as to what is GF. The polenta and cheese bread are both GF. Pineapple was delicious! They even have a great selection of gf desserts., This place is awesome. They label everything and there is only like one or two things on the salad bar that are not safe to eat. Food is amazing too. I had zero issues here., We had a fantastic experience at Rodizio Grill. We had diners who were vegetarian, gluten free, egg allergic and combinations of all three. There was plenty to eat for everyone. Everything is clearly labeled so you can see what you can and cannot eat and the staff was very knowledgeable about the gluten free diet. They even had a dedicated fryer for their polenta. We had a large party, multiple checks, and changed our reservation multiple times but they were super accomodating, friendly and helpful and the food was delicious. Again, this was a gluten free friendly place with MANY unique options, a dedicated fryer and multiple GF dessert. Everything was delicious and meat eaters, vegetarians and GF diners were satisfied. We were there on mother's day and they even gave gifts to the moms!... Thank you Pinky, Hector, Wayne and Naelly, This is my favorite gluten free restaurant in Lincoln! I have eaten at Rodizio Grill several times and have never been sick. The food is delicious, fresh, and well presented. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff. I love the deserts too., No complaints! Excellent food options, wonderful staff and great atmosphere!!! Anytime I can go to a restaurant and eat without concern or worry I am extremely pleased! OAN they have these delicious cute little GF cheese rolls!!! 👍🏽, My favorite for gluten free dining when I don't want to feel singled out by limited menu options. Just about everything is gluten free with a few exceptions. Wait staff is knowledgeable and helpful. Yum!, Food is fabulous. Hostess, manager, and wait staff were all knowledgeable and conscience of my boyfriend's allergies. He's allergic to soy, gluten, dairy and all legumes, and he still had plenty to eat. They gave him a list of allergens in every item. Highly recommended if you want a nice meal out in Nashville and don't want to get poisoned., Fantastic food, fantastic environment, fantastic staff. Many, many delicious GF options!, Never an issue here. And delightful food! Just wish it was a little less pricey. :), Talk to your servers and you'll be fine, You get what you pay for, incredible food. The staff is always polite and knowledgeable., We celebrated my wife's birthday with a party of 5 Celiacs / Gluten sensitive family members in our party of 20. Our server was also a Celiacs. All food brought to the table was GF and almost all food on the salad bar was GF and clearly labeled. It was our 4th visit. Food was excellent., Meats are a bit too salty for my tastes. Servers are often skimpy on the meat serving sizes. Go to the bar and get a plate full and supplement with servers' offerings., 95% gluten free and everything was specifically marked. The only items that contained gluten were at the salad bar. Food was very good!, Great to see that almost 95% was GF. Felt good to not be in the minority for food selections. Great staff that knew about allergies. definitely two thumbs way up...., Cafeteria style place. They mark the bins pretty well, but who knows. I got glutenated by something., So far so good. I'd be cautious about the meat selection as some sauces or seasonings that they use to marinate their meat may contain gluten. However, my girlfriend and I have been able to confidently here with no problems, In the salad bar everything gluten free was marked. As a VERY sensitive celiac, I had zero issues. I highly recommend the gluten free crème brûlée., Omg, this place is great. Staff is outstanding, very knowledgeable & friendly.
Large selection of meats and sides, all fantastic.

They change their gloves and spoons. The other 20 percent they need me to ask for them to change their gloves and spoons. One person even washed her hands changed her gloves and then placed her hands on a tortilla ""what would you like"" lol but I go there a lot., Excellent food and service!, Everything gluten free except tortillas!, Chipotle does not have a gluten free menu but instead has a list of gluten-containing ingredients to avoid. Cross-contamination is a concern, however, so let the person taking your order know that you are gluten free and if you need them to take the proper precautions.
From their website: ""If you avoid gluten, don't eat our flour tortillas. If you are highly sensitive to gluten and would like us to change our gloves, just let us know at the start of your order. You should be aware items containing corn, including corn tortillas (chips, soft corn, and crispy corn tortillas) and corn salsa, may have a small amount of gluten from potentially co-mingling with gluten-containing grains in the field.""... Chipotle is one of my ""go to"" places. I visited this location while in town and it was great., Traveling with celiac can be emotionally draining. I walked in and asked if they were familiar with what gluten is, no hesitation and was answered yes, gloves off, hands washed, new gloves on and started changing utensils. All the employees seemed to know how to handle things to keep me safe. A thank you to the employees there is not really enough as the same restaurant down the road looked at me like I was crazy when I asked about gluten free options. Great lunch with great service, can’t beat that!😊, They’re always willing to Change gloves and I feel safe eating there., I always get sick from this place. I mention my allergy and they change their gloves/ get separate spoons but they put the spoons in the same main containers.... their chips are NOT gluten free. They told me they were and I got very sick not educated at all apparently, Had no clue what gluten free is despite their menu offering a gluten free tortilla or taco shell., Every filling is gf.
The only thing not gf is the tortilla. Which is sad because real tortilla are made from corn not wheat.
Take the bowl then, Will wash hands, change gloves and use disposable scoopers if you inform them of your ""allergy."" Everything is gluten free except for the burrito wraps. The shredded cheese and lettuce is grabbed with their gloves so it would be cross contaminated. They will get fresh from the back if you ask. I just try to avoid going when it's busy as to not hold up the line. 🤷🏼, I asked them to change gloves because of an allergy to the tortilla. He immediately dropped the tortilla he was holding directly over top of the rice containers. Then washed his hands, changed gloves and grabbed the empty tortilla wrapper. He crumpled it up threw it away and then asked if I wanted a fresh tortilla and opened the new tortillas..... Need I say more?, i found a long strand of hair in my burrito and the rice was definitely undercooked, i could taste how hard some rice were. the meat was dry and too bland. everything was too salty and i couldnt even finish my food. TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!, They refused to serve me, citing cross-contamination. I even emailed their headquarters. They said no.... They refused to serve me, citing cross-contamination. I even emailed their headquarters. They said no.... They refused to serve me, citing cross-contamination. I even emailed their headquarters. They said no., Most things here are naturally gf, and staff will change gloves if asked.... Bowls, tacos, and salads can be gf, as are chips and even the queso, Many delicious gluten free options, I have been going to this location for years and have never had an issue with an employee not changing their gloves and wiping down the counter... Just say you have a gluten allergy and they will go change gloves!, We travel alot and give Chipotle for a quick easy meal. I am C but say gluten allergy for ease of explanation. They changed gloves. Were very helpful and kind., I got sick, not celiac friendly, Wipe down the counters/where they make the food, change gloves, utensils, and get fresh toppings specifically for allergies... quality and quantity is about the same as if someone wasn’t ordering gluten free... Manager trained a new worker right in front of me and he was extremely knowledgeable and careful about cross contamination., DO NOT GET CHEESE ! I repeat do not get cheese. Even if employees change gloves the cheese is still extremely contaminated. Watch the employees hands as they make someone's food. The first thing they do is touch a tortilla with their glove. The last thing they do is touch the cheese WITH THEIR GLOVE., Always have been knowledgeable and changed gloves and pulled food from fresh containers to avoid cross contamination when informed., Stopped by on our way to South Dakata. They did a great job with preparing my food safely!, When I was here and mentioned I had celiac, staff wiped everything down, took out old spoons from the containers, washed hands/changed gloves, then put got clean utensils and new lettuce. Didn’t even have to ask them to change gloves or get new utensils! Very well trained!, Chipotle ALWAYS gets it right! They wash hands, change gloves, switch utensils, & inform all of the staff down the line! They’re the best & ROCK SOLID for a celiac, especially during travel!... Corn based & fantastic! The only flour in the kitchen is the large burrito wraps, all else is GF!... Eating here is 100% safe, 100% of the time🔥, The only thing with gluten here is the tortillas. Get a bowl, and you won't have any problems at all. I've gone many times without even mentioning my allergy with no problems at all., Most of the time I don’t even have to explain. I just say that I have celiac and they change their gloves and get clean spoons. And they don’t touch the serving spoon to anyone’s food.... The only thing that has gluten is the tortilla.... It’s my go to place for lunch or dinner, Love this place! It’s my favorite fast food place to go to because the only thing that isn’t gf is their flour tortillas., No precautions taken at all. If you wait in line and watch them, it’s basically gluten city. Asking them to change gloves (or put some on because they often don’t wear any) is irrelevant because they touch the flour tortillas with all utensils and allow everything to contact other items. Frequently they’ll overfill and put an ingredient BACK in the tray. So there’s massive x-contamination. DANGER!, They have gloves on and a plexiglass in front of the food and during this crisis they have masks on at all times... You can have a bowl with the same toppings as a burrito, This is seriously the most conscientious Chipotle I have ever eaten in. I live nearby and eat here about once a month. They change all the spoons, wipe down the counter and get out fresh lettuce for me. I have never gotten sick at this location. They are the best. Just let them know before you order and they will take care of you. I am not celiac but very sensitive., They did not change their gloves. Told me they ran out of separate toppings. Same work space... It May have just been this location because usually all chipotles are a safer option, but they told me they ran out of toppings and just threw what they could in my bowel. The same toppings that were touched by flour tortillas and I’m sure there was cross contamination! Truly disappointing! 1 Star, Staff didn’t know what to do . Needed to be asked to put in clean gloves and reminded to use clean utensils. The last time I went to this location I thought they were knowledgeable and did a nice job. Today’s crew had not been trained properly. Also their COVID-19 precautions were very lax. Masks worn improperly or around their necks. Probably won’t be back.... Their COVID-19 precautions were very lax. Masks worn improperly or around their necks. Probably won’t be back., Honestly, I’ve gotten sick eating here twice mostly because I do not think the staff cared about my allergy. Only at a few bites and got sick quick. I ordered according to their online menu that was GF, They do wipe down the counters and change their gloves after washing their hands. They take out the condiments straight from the bag below the buffet style service., The staff was polite and changed gloves when I ordered my rice bowl. However, I noticed as they made someone else's burrito that the serving spoons touched the flour shell and then they put the spoon back in the container. I got extremely sick and suspect it was from cross contamination on the spoons., I have a very sensitive gluten intolerance and every time I try their food I get my symptoms... Only on their website/ nutrition info you can find gluten free information, They are very nice and will always change gloves when asked. I have never in my life gotten sick, and I have eaten here a lot.... If you eat here you cannot get a burrito or a taco, but you can get a bowl! The bowls have all the same stuff that the burritos and tacos have, except for the shell/wrap/tortilla. Everything they put inside the food is gluten free. The chips are also all gluten-free corn chips., They do use flour wraps. But if you tell the worker you are gluten free they will change their gloves, change the spoons, and should also change the lettuce and cheese containers since they stick their hands in with the gluten gloves... Very yummy of course. Gone here for years., Kudos to the manager who upon learning that one of the meals was for a celiac (gluten free) person stepped in and with GREAT personal and serving care assured that there was no cross contamination. 5 Stars for the extraordinary care that was exercised, Workers will change gloves, wash hands, wipe down counter, and bag meals separately. They are compliant and very kind!... Everything at Chipotle is gluten free except the tortillas., Everything at Chipotle is gluten free except the flour tortillas. I LOVE having so many choices!!!, They’ve definitely gone downhill. Last time I got their food, it wasn’t very good (dry chicken, missing ingredients) and I was sick afterwards for several days. Can no longer recommend, I love chipotle! They never disappoint, they always give you a good amount of food. I usually get a bowl and most items on their menu are gluten free and celiac safe., The folks working here were super conscientious about changing gloves, wiping the counter, and using new tongs when I told them of my gluten allergy. The food was great and I feel great!, Cross contamination is high if they don’t change gloves or use fresh utensils. Not Celiac safe. Informed them of this but my meal had evidence of other salsas and meat, so it appears utensils were not changed even though requested. Stopped eating as soon as saw this but still having gluten reaction, Will change gloves, wash hands, and get separate cheese and lettuce if you ask. It really depends on the person you get when you order though. I’ve had both really good and really bad experiences. Most of the time the workers are very friendly but I’ve had a few of the workers get visibly irritated when I tell them I have celiacs.... The food is always good. I love getting the rice bowls and they’re fantastic.... I would give it 5 starts if some of the employees weren’t so rude. A few get visibly upset when they have to wash their hands and change their gloves. It’s just an unsettling feeling when they’re making your food and it’s honestly just really rude., Delicious clean ingredients and they’ll change their gloves and spoons if you tell them you’re gluten free., I've eaten at other chipotles and been ok, but I'm having a major wheat reaction this morning. It's possible it's one of my other sensitivities, but none of them give me this reaction that I know of. ... When I ordered, I told the server about my restrictions. He didn't change his gloves like I've seen at other franchises, nor replace the serving utensils. Like an idiot, I didn't ask him to because I didn't anticipate it being a big deal. And I didn't want to make his life harder during the pandemic. But... Ow., Will wash hands and change gloves if you ask.","Celiac Cassie,Jed,Todd,Sara,JW,Mic,Keena,merilyn,Lauren,Marcduf,Kassie,Mark,Luna,Marsha,Meghan,Leanne,Caleb ,Monique,Katie,aanya,Wil,Ttomeo,Mike,Elizabeth,Marcie Ellen,Zach,Krista,Amelia,Joey,Lucy,Corbin,KarenW,Breanna,chris,LeeAnna Collier,Madalyn,Michelle,Courtney,Sarah,LaÉabha,Brenna Tkac,Tom,Nora,Jenny,Suzanne,Maia,Celia,Amy,JillianKara,Talia,jennifer,K,sophie herrema",CO,6,2,35,80211

Menu is clearly marked., Love the gluten free flatbread pizza. Have eaten here plenty of time and have never had an issue with being celiac. Staff is very knowledgeable able making sure the kitchen is aware of that., Delicious steak and potatoes! I’m a super sensitive celiac and the chef and wait staff were very accommodating. They assured me I would be safe eating there and I was! So happy to have been able to enjoy a quality meal with absolutely no reaction!, Thought this place would be ok, since the managers were so helpful, and the restaurant is so high end, but sadly I had a horrible reaction to my steak and vegetable., Excellent menu clearly labeled GF. Fantastic food. Pork chop was fantastic. Best gluten free mini pizza I have ever had!, We went for my husband’s birthday. Our son with Celiac got sick at the restaurant after eating the GF flatbread. I called the restaurant and was told that the President of the company has Celiac. I left my name and number for a manager callback and haven’t received a call in 1.5 weeks., I wouldn’t recommend this as GF the waiter didn’t have knowledge about GF cross contamination and it says at menu risk of CRoss contamination, Sat down- asked a few cross contamination questions and didn’t like the answers I got. Server seemed to think simply using a GF crust meant no worries. Place seemed nice and food could be great- but didn’t feel like risking it for my kid. Rating not a reflection of the food or the people- just the knowledge of the server about cross contamination. Everyone was nice there., Went here on NYE. Food was okay but over priced. Waitress came to me after to ask, “There was no dairy right?! Food seemed okay?” (I have both a gluten and dairy intolerance) Won’t return for a while., Amazing mushroom flatbread omg it was perfection definitely going back I never got sick and I have celiac but that is the only thing I’ve ordered, I had the flatbread pizza and it was very good. I substituted chicken for the Italian sausage since it wasn’t gf. Enjoyed this pizza a lot!, Overall excellent experience, the waitstaff was knowledgeable about allergies (GF/DF), the main menu is clearly marked with GF options (salads, seafood, chicken/steak), the food was excellent and I did not get sick eating here. If you enjoy seafood and steaks, this restaurant is for you! My only recommendation would be additional GF options for sides., I got the roasted tomato flatbread and it was soooo good! Didn’t get sick!, Love going here.
I get burratta which is great. I order steakhouse salad- gluten free... and I’m so grateful for salted caramel pudding cup (GF) - great lunch place for me., The menu is labeled GF so you know exactly what to order. I had the GF pizza and it was delicious!, Incredible service, great gluten free menu, Tell the manager you are Celiac, and they take great care of you. Food was excellent., Gluten free flatbread was a great appetizer! I also had the brick chicken which was marked as gluten free and was delicious., Plenty of GF options on the menu. Staff is very knowledgeable and said they can modify many of the entrees. Started with the GF flatbread mushroom arugula that was excellent. Was with my father and didn't know I ordered the flatbread as GF. HE LOVED it. Selected the signature steakhouse salad which was phenomenal! I'll be back!, Food is good, but don't trust the menu- gf marked items may not be gluten free. For example the French fries were marked GF but when I asked, they don't have a separate fryer so they are not celiac friendly., A few of each section of the menu are gf, and more can be made to order. Quick service, good food., Food was good, staff was okay we had to ask plenty of questions. It's a bit pricey for only decent food., Items that are GF are clearly marked on the menu. Got the roasted artichokes and the 16oz NY Strip. Steak was cooked perfectly and the char on the outside was outstanding. Worth the price., GF items are clearly marked on the menu, they'll even do their flatbread pizzas with a GF crust.","Cathie ,Wanda,bri,Marissa,A.,Amanda,Dana,Team Celiac,SO,hailey Vankeuren ,Nancy,GF/DF,Sam,Jan,Isabella,Kristina,Mary H,Allyson,Philly_Jasper,jbold ,beth ,gfwifey9,Gino Ferrazzano,Amy",CO,7,4,16,80206

California Pizza Kitchen is one of the chains we look for when on vacation. They have a dedicated area and our son likes the pizza a lot. I think it's good, not great but it's his opinion that matters!, I usually just get the Moroccan chicken salad, which is quite delicious. When they first offered GF pizza, I tried it. It was pretty good but dry inside, greasy outside. At least they were careful, and I didn't get sick. The manager did come out and explained their strict safety process, which I appreciated. Perhaps they they have improved their recipe., They take gluten free very seriously at this location! I’ve been a couple times to get their gluten free pizza, and the staff has been very knowledgeable every time. They have a separate gluten free menu they can give you, as well as a separate oven in the kitchen where they cook gluten free pizzas. They always stick a little “gluten free” sign in your pizza as well.... The gluten free cauliflower crust is amazing! I would honestly prefer it over regular crust, it tastes better and is healthier. I always get the margherita pizza and love it.... I must add though that I don’t generally get sick if I have a bit of cross contamination, I am just judging off of how well-informed they are and how seriously they take it., They have certified gf pizza that is prepared at a separate station with separate ingredients. I've had the traditional cheese, margherita, and bbq chicken pizzas, all delicious! Service is always friendly and knowledgeable., They have 5 gf pizzas that are part of their “certified” gluten free pizzas. There are also other menu items marked gluten free but are not certified. Our pizzas came out with “gluten free” flags on them. They didn’t have the gluten free menus at this location but we referenced their website and our server knew right away which 5 were gf.... There are 5 “certified” gluten free pizzas available in 2 sizes (kids size or regular size).... I didn’t see any dairy free options for pizzas if you are also dairy free (try mellow mushroom if you need gf/df)., BBQ chicken pizza is so good!, They have gluten free certified pizzas. Their procedures are certified by The Gluten Intolerance group.... Not many GF options but what they have is tasty!, My husband has celiac and cannot have dairy or gluten. After going over his allergies, they still put dressing with dairy on his salad. Bc they did not have dine in, we go it to go and did not realize the dressing was there until we left. He did eat the salad bc the dressing was in a separate container and hoped he would be ok. However, he had a bad reaction. There was no one in the restaurant. If they can’t get it right when they don’t have any customers, I would not trust them when they are busy., Had a great gf pizza! Wonderful service! Definitely will be back! Also very good about social distancing!!, Dedicated gluten free kitchen for pizza... Average GF pizza but I trust the safety. 100% premade in GF designated celiac safe kitchen. Tested no gluten found with Nima!... Dale the server was VERY knowledgeable, about GF and safe alcohol beverages as well, They have Gluten free pizza cauliflower crust. They have kids and adult size. Amazing restaurant. Has great food. I will definitely go there again!!!, This is not the best gluten free pizza crust, being a bit soggy. But it allows me to scratch the pizza itch without getting sick.... I used to LOVE this restaurant: pizza, pasta, salads, egg rolls, soup...all delicious!, They have a “gluten free menu” and then a Gluten Free Menu, where all the ingredients are handled in a way to prevent cross contamination. When I told the server I was celiac, they brought out the manager to discuss safe options for me.... I had never been here before, it was a lot nicer than I thought it would be. I thought it would be more like a pizza hut? It was very nice, a little on the pricey side, though., Ordered takeout from Kahala Mall CPK, told them that I my daughter was celiac and they immediately transferred me to a manager to make sure that her needs were met. Her pizza was completely safe and was even packed in a totally separate bag. She had a good pizza with no problems., They have a certified gluten-free kitchen... The Gluten-free pizza was yummy... It’s celiac friendly, — All food and drinks are gluten-free, Great Food. Wonderful servers. But they got my pizza wrong 4 times to my daughter and they gave me Gluten, Celiac safe for only their Certified Gluten Free pizzas. There are five of them. They are pretty good and I’m happy to have an option., They have a cauliflower crust for all pizzas and salads that are GF. I got a pizza and cobb salad. ... Easy to order and was close to restaurant taste! 🤙🏼, We ordered the bbq chicken pizza and the pepperoni for our party. The manager came over to tell us they are cooked in a separate part of the kitchen to ensure no cross contamination., The GF pizza is so good I made the waitress double check that they didn’t send out the wheat based crust by accident! 4-5 pizza options, wish they had a GF salad option; hopefully that is coming. Staff is knowledgeable and always treat Celiac as serious., Their training is impeccable. Such a relief to be able to eat a meal out with friends and not feel stressed about it. I love that they label “made without gluten containing ingredients” differently from their celiac safe choices (which is a small but good selection of cauliflower crust pizzas.) All restaurants should follow their excellent model!, I asked the server for an allergy menu and he immediately asked if it was celiac because they have a separate celiac menu that is made in a specific area of the kitchen than just a “gluten free” menu item is. Highly recommend, i’ve eaten this pizza several times without a reaction (at the Ashford-Dunwoody location in Atlanta). They have a separate pizza station for preparing GF pizza. It goes in the same oven as other pizza but in its own pan.. The thing that worries me the most is when they are preparing at the gluten-free station, their bellies are covered with flour for making the regular pizzas. But again I haven’t gotten sick from this location.... I forgotten what a real pizza taste like, but I love the gluten-free pizza from CPK. The only pizza in Atlanta where I like the sausage. Note the frozen version of the sausage pepperoni and mushroom from the store, is nowhere close to the pizza they make at the restaurant., Definitely celiac friendly. The problem was the pizza was not good. Thin burnt crust very little sauce al dried up., The gluten pizza was absolutely delicious!
This is my favorite place., Certified gf pizzas.. decent pizza- has better but safe, AVOID AVOID AVOID SO SICK!!! got the pepperoni, Service was great. Very attentive once I notified them I was celiac and the pizza was tasty, Staff was very kind and brought out manager to assure pizza would be gluten free! The prepped it in a separate area and there was 0 cross contamination. I love it and would go back in a heart beat!, Designated GF items on the menu. Gluten-free cauliflower crust pizza delicious! Staff very helpful and well informed about gluten-free., Great experience at CPK. Gluten free pizza was brought out by manager and was delish!, At least they are very honest about heavy cross-contamination. I am non-celiac wheat allergy and can tolerate cross-contamination usually, but I still got sick from eating their cauliflower crust pizza. Stay away., Another great pizza here! Don't stray much from the food or pizzas shown on the separate gf menu but you can get a good, safe meal here., Ordered the barbecue chicken pizza and it was so good! Pizzas are certified gluten free and the manager brought my pizza out specifically for me. I will be back, We decided to eat here as we needed a quick dinner option and they had tables open. The menu says they are able to accommodate allergies, however our server was not knowledgeable about celiac and was trying to offer me salads that didn’t even have a gluten free symbol by them. My husband got up and asked for a manager while the server was still talking to me because she was ignoring him when he tried to talk. The manager was very helpful and accommodating. She offered for my pizza to be cooked on a pan so that it wasn’t touching the oven surface. She also recommended that I only get cheese or a couple ingredients to minimize risk of contamination. So although there weren’t many options for me, she was transparent about what they could provide and I ended up not getting sick. Would not recommend this location for celiacs., Service was bad, pizzas arrived burned. Many other options here. Skip the drama..., My husband has celiac. CPK went out of their way to make sure his food was safe and were very attentive. Their gf pizzas are certified gluten free., Excellent!!!!! I was there with my mom and my brother (the 3 of us are Celiac) and OMG it was excellent! The taste is amazing, they have special care for the gluten free pizzas. And the best thing is that its certified by GiG!, Staff knows how to prepare GF without issue. They were very careful (I sat at the bar and watched them make our food). We eat here a couple/few times when we are in Anaheim., Excellent staff knowledge. Not for this venue as they have full understanding but in general Be sure to specify when you go anywhere to eat that you are a medically diagnosed coeliac and not just gluten friendly which indicates life choice. Traveling around USA has proven more challenging than ever anticipated. We will be eating here as good cross section on menu available. Makes travelling life so much easier. Thank you, I have eaten at the foxwoods, Ct location tons of times, not alot of options, but the pizza is always amazing !! Prices not bad either, never had any issues., I had a deliciou gluten free pizza., Ingredients made in separate area- very knowledgeable staff- no issues and pizza is good!, The GF pizza did not make me sick. I sat at a booth that overlooked the kitchen so I was able to watch my dinner being made and I was happy about the process to reduce cross contamination. Not dedicated GF but a pretty good option. ... Per the website

They are very careful to cook everything separately, and it always come with a gf stick in it for reassurance., Perfect! Great service great pizza and most importantly no issues, My kid was so excited to try this place and adored their cauliflower crust—however even after asking them to ensure it’s gluten free, they did not use their dedicated space to make his. Apparently you have to be very explicit and tell them to make sure they use their allergy protocols. Just saying gluten free isn’t enough for them to do so. He was very ill after., Ordered two gluten free pizzas from here and made sure to note it was for someone with Celiac. I felt great after eating them and didn’t have any symptoms. It’s mediocre pizza, but such a convenient option! I’m grateful! They stepped up their game to be Celiac safe!, This is my go to pizza place! The staff are very knowledgeable.

I called ahead and verifed they had certified gluten free pizza available and they did. When we arrived I informed our server of our daughter's celiac diagnosis and felt comfortable that they were using proper procedures when handling her pizza. Food arrived and was labeled with a little pick that said gluten free. We even ordered 2 take and bakes that were certified gluten free also! My daughter was thrilled and I was grateful for such a smooth, safe dining experience. We will definitely visit this location again!, Had a delicious bbq chicken pizza and didn’t get sick.

If you tell them you have Celiac and it’s not a preference, they will use extra caution including cooking it on wax paper and changing out spoons.
The variety of fresh ingredients make it easy to mix it up and still taste good., Like a Chipotle for pizza, Rise Pies has always done a good job at avoiding cross contamination and as a very sensitive celiac person, I have never had any issues. And the pizza is great!, Really nice friendly place. Staff inquire as to whether the gluten free base is dietary or allergy base. Once I said allergy, she changed her gloves got everything for the prep and cooking and washed them thoroughly in front of me. Cleaned and work space and did the same with the pizza paddle and pizza cutter. These people actually care about GF customers and it tasted awesome!!!!, NOT celiac friendly! Definitely a mess of flour everywhere. They do put the gf pizza on a black protective sheet but then when its done it gets put straight into the box and the paper gets pulled out leaving all of the crumbs from the oven in the box., I am Celiac. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. They changed gloves, had a gluten free crust kept completly separate from the other crusts. Brought ingredients from the back that had not been on the line...overall wonderful experience and great service. The pizza was delicious., They have a GF crust but absolutely no precautions. Flour everywhere. The staff was aware of celiac disease and honestly advised me not to try it. I appreciated their honesty., Unfortunately had a horrible experience here.

The readily admitted that they mix their own dough there and couldn’t guarantee against cross contamination. ... What they did do was immediately change gloves, the got new ladles for sauces, used Teflon sheets for the GF crust and pies, got new pizza cutters, etc. The entire team was well trained and took this seriously. I felt safe., I used to enjoy Rise Pizzas. Unfortunately since becoming diagnosed with Celiac. I realize that the cross contamination is huge. They have gluten free pizza crust and place it on a separate paper, but the counter tops were covered in flour. So it’s in the air as well. Sad to give this one up., When I ordered a gluten free crust, the man taking my order asked if it was for preference or allergy. When I said allergy, he apologetically pointed out that as much as he could tell me that the food going on to my plate was gluten free, there was ""flour everywhere"", and he couldn't guarantee that my food wouldn't come in contact with it. He went so far as to tell me that if it was ""a matter of life and death"", I should probably reconsider my order. It was hit and miss on how much protection they offered - thick wax paper down on my board before putting my crust down (good), no glove changes between working with glutened and gluten free pizzas (bad), all pizzas cooked in the same oven (bad). Dedicated gluten free pizza cutter (good), stored touching the glutened pizza cutter (bad). If you have trouble with reactions to cross contamination, you should probably skip Rise Pies. If you're typically OK on that front, you should be fine, and get a pretty good pie - probably the best GF crust I've tasted!, Not celiac safe! They use the same sauce on gluten free and regular pizzas. They place the pizza on parchment to bake, but crumbs from regular pizzas get on the parchment as they move it around. They have a dedicated gluten free pizza cutter, but an inexperienced staff member used the wrong one at first and then switched when I reminded them. Would not chance it., they offer gluten free crust however it's completely contaminated when they assemble the pizza., Gluten free crust and they try not to cross contaminate., Build your own on a gluten free pizza available. Consumer to a glove change when requested. Very very sweet staff., was slow I had to ask them to use fresh spoons and sauces and they said they could not do it when busy, spoon up sauce. touch wheat pizza. put spoon back in container of sauce. repeat many times.....now use poison sauce on gluten free pizza.

The bowls are varied and change based on the seasons, but incorporate many different vegetables. They usually just offer 3 different desserts, a brownie, an olive oil lemon cupcake (my favorite) so moist and flavorful, and a chocolate chip cookie with other add ins. Best of all they are all gluten free! The only down side is they have not installed any sound proofing in the ceiling and as this is a very popular restaurant it can be incredibly noisy during rush times., Lots of options which are gluten free. It is also easy to eat with other food sensitivities. I am dairy free as well. They were knowledgeable and made the ordering simple. It is a good place to go with a large group, and the food is very good. I will go back., Great food and brownies too! Highly recommend, Tasty and healthy. I've eaten here several times and they've always been helpful and aware of gluten issues., We enjoyed this cute restaurant and found it thanks to this app. I loved the Mother Earth bowl which had an explosion of flavors from ancient grains, sweet potatoes, avocado, cucumber and more. You could opt to add protein to any dish, sustainable salmon, grass fed steak, natural chicken or tofu. My Celiac teen loved the mac and cheese with chicken and hubby opted for a chicken plate with brown rice and fruit. So many gfree options and the cookie was delicious, too!! Wish they had a location in Illinois. They had alcohol options and homemade kombucha., Amazing food- knowledgeable about GF everything is labeled too, I’ve been here five times. Menu items marked GF. First four times I was fine and enjoyed. On the latest visit, they very clearly didn’t handle cross contamination correctly and I was sick all night. I guess the hostess or chef were new and didn’t understand/remember what meant by Celiac and no cross contamination. Otherwise usually nice menu options., Fantastic yummy food with lots of gluten free options and a really pleasant atmosphere. Staff are very knowledgable and will take extra precautions for celiacs. All their desserts are gluten free and made in house. So happy to have Flower Child in the neighborhood!, Good service, good food, with lots of gluten-free and vegetarian options and everything is clearly marked on their menu. If you ask about gluten-free items they ask if it’s for an allergy and they change their gloves. My favorites are the Thai dye wrap and the forbidden rice. All their deserts are gluten-free. I’ve had the coconut chocolate pudding and it was perfect. The meals do tend to get expensive, though. The gluten-free wrap is a couple dollars extra and the forbidden rice does not come with protein, so if you order tofu with it it’s also extra. They have lots of fresh vegetables. Portion sizes exactly suit me, but I could easily see it as insufficient for a larger man or someone very active., A very cute place to eat vegan & gluten free. The staff was very friendly and ensured me that they take good care of allergies (glove change,..). I had the glow bowl which is made out of sweet potato noodles, that was very delicious I would totally recommend it!","Alexa,Mel,mbrads16,Tianna,rob,Julie,Lindsey F Stiles,JFT,Ryne,Ryan Morales,Pastorm,Chris ,CAS,Raeann,Traveling Sprue,Barbra,kelly,C,Virginia,lisa rapp,Rachel,danny,Ginger,Ashley,Rachel,Paige Pelot,Jennifer,Hayley,kpicard,Amee,Kimberly,Cat,Jesse,Kim,Dylan Meier,Aimee,Marissa,Stu,CeliacandtheBeast,Cameron,GF Liz,Traveling Sprue,Sherij,Skigal,robyn klein,Nathan,Mary,jess,SillyYak,Joanne Cousins,A,Alicia",CO,32,2,41,80206

Small portions for the price but everything is always delicious., If I could give this place 6 stars I would. There were lots of options for all sorts of dietary restrictions. I ate the salmon curry and it was amazing. I usually am just glad when things are GF, but the real win is how fresh and amazing everything is., amazing wrap and soup! highly recommend., Great salads, sandwiches and pizza. They are always so careful and so nice about it, too!
I agree with Abbey- it's not always really filling, but it's consistently delicious and really GF., Great options, and has never gotten me sick. The only downside is it's not always very filling., Literally the best pizza ever. And their sandwich wraps are so freaking amazing. I'm in love with this place. And it's affordable. I wish it was closer to me!, omg best pizza ever! i get the white pizza with artichokes on it. the farmers salad is also good. and their sandwiches are great! can't go wrong!, I just tried their gluten-free pepe pizza. It was tasty but the crust was very thin like a wrap or tortilla. If you're super hungry, I recommend getting the full size pizza instead of the half. I got the half and I still feel starvy. It's a good bet though if you're out and about and craving pizza. The close proximity to Pinkberry doesn't hurt either ;), I was a little unsure about safety but the staff reassured me. When I ordered I told them I can’t have any gluten and that I need the space cleaned and gloves changed. She put gluten allergy with my order so everyone on the assembly chain cleaned the space and changed gloves.... I got the tofu bowl with double vegetables and all I got to say is that sesame tofu sauce is above excellent and I can actually eat it! I actually bought a small container of it to take home because it is so freaking good. I love this place because my whole family can eat here and everyone gets food they enjoy., This place is great! Pretty casual, I'd compare it to a Panera Bread because you order at the counter and has a cozy vibe; but much better! I had a BLT-A on gluten free bread. It was really good! I want to go back and try their pizza. My husband had one of their grain bowls and really liked it., Pretty good selection of gf dishes they can prepare and decent service. I usually get the salmon bowl with curry., So yummy. Am celiac and did not get sick., Everything was a little weird but I ended up not getting sick so I’m ok with it. ... I asked what if the GF items was celiac safe and they didn’t know there was a difference. Ok.... so I ordered conservatively (egg hard boiled and just a salad bowl) and was fine. Fountain drinks were questionable but I had a lemonade and was ok! ... Would go back here if I was in the area again., I love their gf pizza, bowls, and sandwiches. I've eaten here several times, but I did get sick once from eating a pizza that was cross contaminated., Amazing food. Great GF Menu. More than 1/2 the items are available Gluten Free. ... 
Unique fresh options. ... 
My favorite is the gluten free corn and bacon pizza. I would never have thought of this combination. It is amazing!, Solid gluten free restaurant. Eaten many times with no issues, Great gf options. I’ve never had a problem and eat here often. There is cross contamination with their pizza due to same pizza oven., I have eaten here many times without any issues. They have plenty of great options as well, I looked at reviews on this chain and decided to give it shot despite having some unsavory reviews about cross contamination. Should have listened. I got a salad and as I was finishing up I found part of a crouton in my salad. Thankfully I didn't have a reaction but I will never eat there again., So good, well marked gf menu, changed gloves, super fresh!! I had the super food salad!! B concourse next to chick-fil-a, Great options for Celiac. Our family will return!
Updated to add both my boys became sick after eating there last night. I told staff there was a wheat allergy and they had the gluten free pizza., The food selection is truly a modern culinary fare and the GF options are available for almost all items.... from Pizza to my new favorite the “Homestyle Bowl”.... I will be back!!!, Never had a problem at this Mod Market. I always order one of the hand carved plates (usually salmon with veggies). Very easy to customize and vegan are on the menu labeled clearly. I still always tell them I have celiac and I haven’t had a problem. Yum!, We had a delicious pizza at this location, they seemed well aware of cross-contamination., Read the reviews but was starving prior to a 5Am departure. Had the bacon breakfast sandwich on the GF bun.... took a few bites.. waited about 20 minutes and felt fine. Ate the rest without a problem. They did have GF items Clearly marked including steel cut oatmeal offerings that sounded good too. I would definitely feel comfortable eating here again., Great options for gf and had no cross contamination issues! Delicious chicken, Love this place! Their sandwiches are so good and everything tastes really fresh., Overpriced sandwiches with almost nothing in them., I've eaten here a number of times without any problems. They have gluten-free bread. I like the avocado toast., Many GF choices. Good food. My fave is salmon plate with salad sides, A lot of reviews are saying it isn’t safe if you get pizza or sandwiches. I got the salmon curry bowl and explicitly told them it was a gluten allergy. It was yummy, fast, and I didn’t get sick. Order smart, communicate, and you should be fine!, I got in line and asked the cashier if they were able to accommodate gluten allergies. “We have gluten free bread.” I then asked if I got a salad if the meat would be able to be prepared on a separate part on the grill. “We have gluten free bread.” Guessing that’s a no for celiac-friendly employees and food!, I enjoyed my salad, food was tasty, So yummy! Basically everything on their menu could be gluten free. Definitely celiac friendly., Good set of choices, friendly and accommodating staff. Good lunch., Food wasn’t so good. My steak was very well done and bland., Don’t think twice. They made a perfect GF sandwich., I think the salads are probably safe, but I ate a gf pizza here yesterday and it made me really sick. Definitely cross-contaminated, so if you're going to eat here, avoid the pizza., Much of their menu is gluten free. Knowledgeable staff., Thai coconut curry chicken salad is amazing, Many of their menu items (salads, grain bowls, soups) are already gluten free, but sandwiches and pizzas can be ordered GF for an upcharge ($1.75 extra for my daughter's sandwich). The side of chips are not GF, but they offer 3 cookie flavors that all are. My husband and daughter thought the GF bread on her sandwich was very good, and both kids (one celiac, one not) liked the GF cookies. Great selection overall. Note: this location has only been open a short time and the staff had to check when we inquired about the GF chips. The menu is clearly labeled., I’ve had the Thai chicken salad twice and tested in my sensor. Each time the sensor shows no gluten and I felt fine. Plus it’s a really good salad., Had the Thai Coconut salad which is labeled gf. Tested ok on sensor and I felt ok after eating., I stopped by and asked the staff about gluten-free options. They didn’t know anything other than that they had gluten-free bread and they did tell me everything was prepared in the same location. I wouldn’t chance it., Awesome food and most of their menu can be made gluten free. Knowledgeable staff. They were happy to change their gloves. Gluten free bread is tasty. This is a chain, and they have other locations nearby., Lots of options for GF! Ordered the BBQ chicken pizza on GF crust, they put it on aluminum to prevent cross contamination, then had their own pizza slicer to prevent issues. Great food, scarfed it down., Had eaten from the 16th st mall location last year without issue but I definitely got sick from cross contamination at this location. Service was rude on top of that., It is so hard to find gluten free food in an airport. The food was great and offered a variety of gluten free sandwiches and pizza!, They can do both gluten and dairy free. The pizza is on point. Love this place., I got the basil chicken sandwich at the Denver Airport. I had to pay extra for the gluten free bread but it tasted so good and fresh. The bread wasn’t dense and spongey like most. My husband who can eat gluten also liked my bread and he hates most gf stuff., Delicious and lots of GF options! I got the Superfood Salad, fresh brewed iced tea and a gluten free chocolate chip cookie., Great choice in Denver Airport Terminal B, Great options, so many to choose from. Food is healthy but tasty. Definitely a new favorite chain, Went once during lunch and had no issues and an awesome bahn mi sandwich. Went back the following week and unfortunately got sick. Very dependent on who is working in the kitchen., Poor selection of gf items. Mostly take out the bread. We didn't stick around to eat. Out of the three of us who, two gf, none of us found anything on the menu to make us want to stay. Can't offer on how the food tastes. Only that the prices were high for such a common menu. Definitely kitsch, Ordered mashed potatoes. When it arrived, it had a piece of macaroni mixed in. Luckily, I saw it before taking a bite. Was scared to finish my food. I asked at the front counter and they said the macaroni was right next to the mashed potatoes on the serving line., Ordered a salad on a layover. Vomited on the plane. Yes gluten free options but maybe not safe for celiacs., Very good. Enjoyed my meal! Lots of options and the menu clearly labels gluten free, dairy free, nuts, etc.","Ami,Heather,Teesha,LVM,Abbey,fleurmegs,Sydney,User,Kian,Katie,FRED,User,sillyyak,Amanda,Linda,Renee,Lezlea,asrith tiguri,Emmie Lou,Tiffany,Angela,Shawn,Jessica P,Nyrene ,mumsyto4,Elissa,Maria,Amanda,L.

Staff is knowledgeable of all the gf options.
I was passing through Denver for a class, but I would definitely try it again next time I'm here., knowledgeable and friendly staff. i told them my food allergies and they let me know what I could eat! Great place, Very good., I always order the same things at Tokyo Joes. It's one of the only places that has never gotten me sick. They know me here I go so much., Gluten-free teriyaki sauce is really tasty and when you order it, they always ask ""allergy or preference?"" Never had a reaction after eating here., I used to love Tokyo Joe's. Whole, healthy food with plenty of veggie and protein options? What's not to like? However, since being diagnosed with Celiac disease, I've been to this location twice. Both times I was clear and polite about being a Celiac, and I love the fact that they even have GF teriyaki available. However, I have been very, very sick within an hour of eating lunch here both times. Maybe I'll try it again one day, but for now, I'm not risking it, I have celiac and another allergy. They didn’t prepare my meal safely. When we tried to resolve the issue, we were given a blank gift card as the refund. When I went to use the gift card, Ronnie wouldn’t redeem it. He said we write these types of things in a book. Then I tried to redeem what he said would be put into the book but he refused to make the situation right. Ronnie should be fired for being unprofessional and displaying poor customer service. I would characterize him as a person who discriminated against folks with food allergies. He would rather not do business with people with food allergies or take responsibility for his staff or his own actions. Avoid this location!!! My secondary allergy is life-threatening anaphylactic and it’s understandable that accidents happen but either reimburse people with a refund or comp their meal at the same value that they spent., Soooo sick after eating here. It’s pretty dirty. Drive to any of the Ftco Locations instead, Absolutely love their gluten free chicken teriyaki bowl! Just tell the staff if you have an allergy and they’ll accommodate and change the cutting boards and gloves., Good food and attention to allergies. Gluten free teriyaki or soy sauce., Food was good but not celiac friendly., I have eaten here 3 times without a reaction. I am a very sensitive person to gluten. The sushi is good enough, but I had a teriyaki bowl last time and it was also good. I didn't think I would eat it all but...I did., Riverside isn’t known for its GF food, but I was pleased to find I had a lot of options here. It’s not the best sushi I’ve ever had, but when I’m traveling I’m pretty much just happy if I don’t get sick. They have poke bowls, bento boxes, and a variety of choices of sauces and proteins. I’d definitely come here again. This place is more of a fast food type of restaurant than a sit-down sushi place., My food did not get me sick, but my brother did get food poisoning from the sushi. I would be careful eating here regarding looking out for things other than gluten., I have eaten at this location several times and never gotten glutened. I always make sure to tell them I have Celiac. The food is delicious, and the staff is super friendly., Celiac here and always have good luck with this location. Menu is clearly marked and staff will take extra precautions if you tell them up front that you are celiac. Great staff who is always friendly and helpful. GF soy sauce is available., Have been very good with allergies., This place seemed pretty good, I age here with no reaction! The staff was very aware of the gluten free options. I felt safer sticking to the rolls rather than trying a whole bowl., Lots of gluten free options, everything is marked on their menu. Sushi staff washed hands and changed gloves before making a gluten free roll. The build your own bowls seem very safe and have very little risk of cross contamination because all of their grilled meats are gluten free and the sauces are kept separate and given to customers in to-go ramekins., First time trying it and it was really good. They have tons of gluten free options. They did ask if it was an allergy so they can make sure to prepare it safely. They even have gluten free soy sauce., Good food and nice people. Not sure if celiac friendly but fun place to go. I’m celiac and I didn’t get sick but I’m nervous to say it’s celiac friendly since there’s always a risk when it’s not dedicated., Delicious food, knowledgeable dude gave me gf info. I had the bahn mi bowl and had no reaction. Definitely recommend, The staff is so careful about gluten free food. On a busy night I ordered a build your own bowl and I added crispy onions which aren’t gluten free. The people cooking noticed right away and were quick to let me know and suggested other things that were gluten free. ... The only downside is it isn’t the fastest place to get take out, but they are careful and it’s definitely worth hanging out for a minute to get your food. Love the atmosphere.... Also most of their sushi is gluten free and almost everything there can be modified to be gluten free., There are a lot of options to choose from. Everything that’s GF is clearly labeled on the menu. Fast, healthy options, careful with cross contamination. We love this place!, I have dined here one time and had a good experience., This is my favorite place to come when I visit Colorado! Their gluten free teriyaki is amazing, and I’ve never once gotten sick. Gluten free is marked on their regular menu!, Loved it! Brought the whole family here to eat (myself and two of my children are celiac) & we were impressed with the selection of gluten-free menu items and sauces! The staff was very friendly and took extra care with our orders to avoid cross-contamination. They changed their gloves and prepared our meals on a safe, separate work station. I was very happy with the food and service, so stoked to finally find another safe gluten-free option :) Amazing job, 5 Stars!, They have everything clearly marked on menu and you can build your own bowl as well. They take care for cross contamination if you ask. Some of the staff had general attitudes so I’m giving a 4 star instead of 5 but the food was good, They have great gf options and do a great job preparing food separately. I eat here all the time and never have a problem!, We went as a special treat. My daughter and I. Have not had trouble in the past. I am not sure if they didnt put allergy on the order or not. But the person who made my sushi didn't change her gloves and plated my daughter non gf sushi on the same plate! They did however give me gf soy sauce. I will not be back!!!!, We eat here routinely and have never had a glutening. It's not a GF restaurant, but if you tell them when you order that you're celiac, they change their gloves and take it very seriously. The food is pretty good, especially for kids and teens. They only have GF teriyaki sauce; I think the other sauces have gluten. But if you're careful about sauce and noodles, pretty much everything else is GF., Best sushi I’ve had in a long time! Very accommodating for someone in from out of town! Highly recommend!!!, Good and fast service with lots of GF options., it's safe but sometimes I think they didn't cook the chicken enough haha, GF clearly marked on the menu, and they'll happily change gloves and prep area. (Anytime you ask for an ingredient to be excluded, they ask ""allergy or preference"".) GF soy sauce available for sushi!, They did a really decent job accommodating me. Food was good, not great. Would return in a pinch., Everything tasted gross. Everyone’s meat was cold and sushi tasted like plastic. Soup was cold nobody in my party liked it. Would not recommend, I'm very sensitive and felt totally fine eating here. They even have GF California rolls (they use real crab meat, not imitation)., This place is hit or miss. Ive had a decent meal, and my companion really enjoyed his. And another time, all 3 of us were highly disappointed., I used to love Tokyo Joe's, but they have really gone downhill fast. They no longer put the gluten allergy alert on the receipt and they start your order before they finish taking it, with no prior notice to the cooking staff that you need to eat gluten free. I get a dismissive ""yeah, yeah"" from the order taker and he finally notifies the cook. That's all in addition to the fact that their portion sizes have decreased and your vegetables are either mushy or raw, nothing in between. I used to go here once a week or more, but I'm done with this place!, They are great with gf and cc. they will change gloves, and when making sushi will even change prep area so it's not cc. I feel safe eating their sushi, as it's real crab, and they don't marinate the fish in soy sauce for flavor like many sushi places., They are great with gf and cc. they will change gloves, and when making sushi will even change prep area so it's not cc. I feel safe eating their sushi, as it's real crab, and they don't marinate the fish in soy sauce for flavor like many sushi places., They have gf sushi and Japanese, plus teriyaki sauce that you can buy fresh that they jar. ❤ So you can go home and make some for a meal later. Prices are reasonable., Food is great but service is terrible. sushi chef gets mad because they have to change gloves for gf. took 20 minutes to get my food last 2 times we went. and I'm pregnant! we won't go back., They have gluten free teriyaki sauce that is brought in a separate container. They have other gluten free sauces as well. The food is very good and they take steps to avoid cross contamination., Healthy options that my family of four loves. We eat here fairly regularly (a few times a month). It's also decently priced for what I consider to be gourmet fast food., This place is great and serves AMAZING food! I have celiac and have never been sick after eating Tokyo Joe's. Food is light and healthy and LOTS of options!, I have been here three times and each time I told them that I have an allergy and need to be GF. Each time I was sick from cross contamination. I have not had issues with other stores, just this one., Delicious and very helpful staff. Good labeling of what is gf., I absolutely had a wonderful experience here. The manager, Mr. Ali Smith greeted us with a smile and set a tone for a relaxed night out with my husband and grandbaby. Everything was made simple with clear marking by all items for any allergies or food preferences. I was very surprised by the ease I had in ordering. The food was very good and we were checked on to make sure we were happy. when we were finished Mr. Smith came over and chatted and we told him about the app I used to find him since he had said many times that gluten free was their specialty, in my opinion they do a spectacular job and are prepared to make boast. I had a great time great food and found me a new gem of a place 😊 I recommend going to see Mr. Ali and see for yourself, Only Tokyo Joes that ever gets me sick. Three times in a row and this location is off my safe list., Great sauce options that are GF. They even asked it GF was an allergy or just a preference. Yum!!, Gluten Free teriyaki sauce, Quite a few gluten free options. Even asked if I had an allergy if they needed to change cutting boards or knives., They have expanded their gluten free options and only use real crab! This reduces contamination risk so much!

I ordered online and specifically told them gluten free- pretty good tasting salad but most of the way through eating, i found a gluten crouton in my salad.., Menu very clear on allergens... So yummy! Lots of great gf options., Great place to eat and was very knowledgeable with what was gluten free and what wasn't., I ordered a gluten free (marked) salad. Half way through my salad, I found a crouton in my food! I complained to them and they were very understanding and made me a new one. I watched them very carefully the second time around. I will say, some areas where they have the food were a little messy and I could see how cross-contamination can occur pretty easily here. Unfortunately, within a couple of hours I felt quite sick. I will not be back., Great salad and bowls with so many gluten free options. Delicious!!!!, AMAZING! I come here routinely. They have a wide selection of gluten free bowls and salads. Very very good!, I am Celiac and eat here frequently! Never have had any issues with being glutened. They are clean, and will take every precaution., Staff is helpful and menu is clearly marked with gf items. There are only a few items in the menu that are not gf. The food is fresh and they will adjust the order if you ask them to do so. Very good place!, I am very sensitive and have never gotten sick here. Their menu is pretty easy to navigate, but they also have an excellent interactive menu on their website. You can choose your dietary restrictions (gluten free, dairy free, etc.) and it will show you exactly what works for you. We have also found the staff to be knowledgeable and their prep procedure to be pretty safe at avoiding cross contamination. They make the food in front of you (think Subway or Chipotle style) and you can easily add or subtract items from the dishes, or create your own. They use a clean metal bowl to assemble the salads for each customer and there is an individual scoop in each ingredient. It’s one of those rare places where I feel like I can order like a “normal” person and don’t have to ask them a million questions to avoid being miserable later., Tell them you have a gluten allergy when you start going through the line and a single person will put your salad together and make sure nothing with gluten goes in., Almost everything is gluten free. However steak and some dressings are not. I usually do a build your own bowl. They have a list of which dressings are gluten free right on the glass where they make the bowls. I’ve been to this location 5 or 6 times and never have gotten sick., They have a nice selection of vegetables and protien. We were able to create our own salads and avoid gluten and dairy products. They do not offer gluten free bread., The staff seemed to be knowledgeable but I still became very ill after eating here., We have eaten here 3 times and every time has been delicious! Everything is fresh and high quality. Place was clean. I highly recommend it for your next Salad., They assured me all salads were gluten free. After I got sick I looked up the salad I had and sure enough the dressing and meat marinade had gluten. Not going back, Granted I visited when it wasn't busy, but the workers took extreme care. Instead of taking ingredients out of the normal containers, the worker went into the back and used entirely new batches of the different ingredients. Most of their dressings are GF!, Got sick two times in a row after having one of the GF bowls., Great--I eat here weekly and the staff is educated about cross contamination., I have celiac disease. They use a clean bowl everytume they make a salad, and the person making my salad washed her hands without me even asking. You can look on their website on their allergy menu and choose no gluten and it will tell you what you can eat. I had the Pomona salad and it was really tasty. I had no issues at all., Many choices gluten-free. Staff very knowledgeable. Great salads., Ordered a salad and found a pasta piece. Don't bother, I have eaten here many times and never had a gluten contamination! I love MAD greens!, Good salads. Possibility of cross contamination, but I had no problems., GF soup was delicious! My salad was good too., They have a whole allergy selection online and things are labeled GF on the menu, Delicious, fresh, flavorful, healthy options and friendly staff., Delicious! Rated no on celiac friendly because of shared kitchen. I've only ordered salads so far but I am celiac and haven't had any issues., This place is AMAZING! Lots of made from scratch gf dressings. Citrus chicken is to die for. I have celiac with a very high allergy & have NOT gotten sick from any MADGreens locations on the east side. I eat here a couple times a week!, This is a good place for gluten free & Lactose free salads., Gluten info was clearly posted. The staff was knowledgeable about what was gluten free, even when it was not posted., My visit was in March 2016 -- the employee I worked with seemed well-trained in cross-contamination issues, and the salad I had was simple but tasty and safe., salad and fresh juice. the juice is made of fresh ingredients and nothing in a bottle. the cups they use are recycled plant material. Great salads!!, Great salads with plenty of options. Dressings are clearly labeled . (Would suggest the red pepper one) ... In regards to the previous review, there aren't very many gluten ingredients to have cross contamination. Obviously it's possible, but unless you are hyper sensitive, you should be fine. (Do any restaurants really ""guarantee"" you won't have issues?) My sister and I (both celiacs) had no problems., Great salads with all allergens of all dressings clearly listed., I had trusted Mad Greens in the past. Yesterday I was told by the Mad Greens employee at different location that there is no chance of me eating there without getting sick. ""We make no guarantees regarding gluten because there are no controls in our food prep. We use the same cutting boards and knives to cut bread and vegetables without washing in between.

I was super impressed and my salad was huge even though I just ordered a regular. she was super sweet and I was happy wasn't treated rude and she got new so no contamination, Staff has always been careful to make sure GF, Meh-it was salad. Nothing great. A bit overpriced for what they are. I wouldn't return., I found the mad greens staff to be extremely friendly and helpful and it is easy to order according to individual dietary needs, Mad Greens is awesome, their food is very delicious and fresh made. They also make it very easy to find what is GF, Very over priced and unfriendly toward questions. Just trying to order is a nightmare, even though the menu is labeled. They look at you like you are crazy for even asking how to order gluten free. Great concept, but too much risk of cross contamination for this Celiac., Great salads and staff understands how to make GF options.","Celeste,Becca,Ecstacia,Jazan,Kerry,Kelly,Allison,Kristi,LuAnn ,Mallory ,Christa,Aly,Janet,Sheri,Cassie,Michelle Gorham ,Stacey,Erica,Lori,gfj,Denise,Kim,Allison,David,Kathy,Claire,Whitney,Melly,Ashley,GF&LF Kent,Krista Dial,MaryKate,Brenda,Derek,Philly_Jasper,gfEmmy,gfEmmy,gfEmmy,gfEmmy,gfEmmy,gfEmmy,gfEmmy,gfEmmy,Jody,Ashton,Shelly,kim,Corrie,Corrie,Kimberly,cpearls",CO,18,12,35,80222

The host warned me about a cross contaminated fryer without me specifically asking. I ordered the pad see ew and pad thai, tested them both with my Nima. Pad see ew tested as glutened :-(. Pad thai, though, came back fine and I had no problems with it even though I'm a fairly sensitive celiac, Ate here with my celiac wife and hyper-sensitive celiac daughter. They had Pad Thai which they really enjoyed and most importantly had no reactions. We’ll definitely be back! The menu was well marked and looked like most items can be ordered ‘gf’.

We have always loved mod pizza and we’re excited this one opened up. They offer GF pizza crust. The staff here appear to be learning, and they haven’t written down our orders when we are there, so we have had a few issues (wrong pizza on GF crust, pizza not in GF crust). Hopefully those will be sorted out. We haven’t had issues at other locations, I told them I had a gluten allergy( celiac) and they changed their gloves but then used the SAME tomato sauce spoon and dipped it into the separate allergy sauce container. It’s a good pizza until I get sick 30 minutes after I eat it. I’d avoid this place*** they put the gluten free pizza right on the same place other pizzas go on. No rubber plate under or anything, Delicious pizza, plenty of topping options, dairy free cheese available at no extra charge. We have ordered from here twice and will definitely be back! Only complaint is that they never cut through the pizza completely so, we just recut it at home., They have a great option for pizza if you're in need of gluten free and dairy free. A cauliflower crust and dairy free cheese with whatever meats and veggies you like to eat. It was delicious!, Dairy free cheese, They change their gloves and be very careful not to cross contaminate. I will not say that it is impossible of cross contamination, but it is highly unlikely... I’ve tasted several different types of pizza in my life. This is by far the best., Cauliflower(GF) crust was delicious but they had a GF crust as well that would also be dairy free. Only in the 11inch size which is a large personal pizza or maybe enough for 2 kids. I will definitely go back & try more of their pizza flavors. Recommend! 👍, MOD Pizza is fun and delicious. Unfortunately, this location does not have a barrier for cooking gluten- free crusts so they cross contaminate. Workers are very friendly and understand celiac., Open Oven baked pizza, customerscan view baking ( done in @5 -7min.) GF Pizza crust & Cauliflower pizza dough available. Customer can choose as many toppings from mixed greens or spinach, various cheeses, meats, veggies & spices and glaze dizzles ( balsamic, pesto, bbq swirl, etc), They have a gluten free crust but it only comes in their 11 inch size, Pizza is good but no confidence in their handling of gluten free ingredients, cross contamination prevalent and they presented a regular crust pizza as a gluten free one. If you have celiac avoid this place., They use to make on a grate in the pozza oven to avoid cross contamination. But they said they are not allowed to do this anymore. So be prepared for cross contamination., Changed gloves and used new pizza cutter. Used clean pizza screen to cook on and grabbed all new food from unused containers so no cross contamination.... It was decent tasting crust.... Not known to be a gluten free establishment, but definitely went out of their way to accommodate., They do have gluten free crust options but this location is definitely not safe for celiacs. I asked for the employee taking my order to change gloves and he immediately informed me that the chances of cross-contamination were too high to even order. Left without anything., I went to the one in Bountiful but it’s the same as other reviews. Not safe for celiac, cross contamination all the way through. They’re rude and not accommodating., Yikes. Not celiac safe! I ordered a gluten free pizza, and the first thing they put on my pizza contaminated jt. They used the same ladle to spread the pizza sauce that they use on gluten pizzas, and they do not put the gluten free pizzas on a tray in the oven. The funny part, was the employee told me she used a new pizza cutter to cut my pizza so she didn’t contaminate me, when the pizza had been very contaminated already. Giving two stars because it was my own mistake.... should have known better when they label the pizza as gluten friendly, but I was in a pinch and starving. If you’re celiac, it’s a no go., “Gluten friendly” is a disgrace at this establishment. The put the pizza directly on the stove. I understand anywhere that is not 100% gluten free cannot guarantee the food to not be cross contaminated. But this place makes no effort., While they did change their gloves they cut my gluten free pizza with the same cutter they used on the regular pizzas. They also stuck it on the same pan. Needless to say I couldn’t eat my pizza., Went to MOD Pizza for my daughter’s fundraiser for school. I was excited to get a gluten free pizza. I advised the girl I’m gluten intolerance. She acted like she didn’t care. She used the same pizza sauce that you would for regular pizza. They put the gf pizza in the same display oven with the others pizzas., Not celiac friendly at all. I let them know that I have a wheat allergy and the employee that prepped my pizza let me know that there was cross contamination everywhere. The words didn't bother me but the annoyed and hateful attitude did. Very different from other MOD establishments., We went here because they said they had gluten free pizza..they had a crust but LOTS of contamination!! When we asked them to change their gloves and stuff some had an attitude well few were very nice about it. They had an attitude and were very rude! Good pizza but WILL NOT BE BACK, Staff is very nice. They also ask if I have an allergy to anything. Gluten free crust is very good. You can also get their cheese bread gluten free too!, They have GF crusts, but there’s cross contamination. They don’t have a dedicated GF oven., Gluten free crust is nasty . Don’t bother going here unless you’re desperate for pizza., Not at all gluten friendly. They put my pizza directly into the oven that was shared with all other pizzas, and used the same spatula to rotate my pizza in the oven as they did gluten pizzas., always get sick here. every single time. even though i make it really clear i have celiac, 2 different GF crust options!! I like one better than the other, haha but can’t remember if it’s the regular GF or the cauliflower one.... Tons of toppings & completely customizable! I don’t have celiac so I can’t speak for the oven, but each pizza stays on its own pan/paper liner & doesn’t touch the actual oven., I’ve eaten several times at this restaurant. They do NOT have a dedicated area but DO have gluten free pizza crust and will change gloves before handling it. I’ve really enjoyed their pizza and never gotten sick., The staff is super knowledgeable about gf and prep! The pizza is the best ever. Accidentally found mod pizza while waiting at the Portland airport and am super happy this one is so close to us! Salad and pizza options galore! Choose off the pre built pizzas or create your own. Gf and gf cauliflower crusts. Loads of toppings! Delicious!, Mod Pizza has a yummy gluten friendly cauliflower crust., She understandingly changed her gloves and told me that it was cooked in the same facility. She also said she would use a separate cutter, but she didn’t., Food was pretty good! Was not overly impressed but hey it’s gf pizza, Was told gluten “friendly” pizza is made with same ingredients as regular pizza. They do not have separate sauce or anything. I picked up some regular gluten containing pizzas for the family members who could eat it. I didn’t get anything. I will not be back., Gluten free (advertised as gluten-friendly) pizza crust. ""Build your own pizza"" offers many options including dairy free cheese!, We were surprised how seriously they took an allergy. They offered to make a gluten free crust and keep it on the pan. They changed gloves and pizza paddles. We did not get sick and were so happy to eat their delicious pizza again., Below avg crust. Go elsewhere if you can., Great place for GF option! I noticed the changing of gloves at every station to suit my needs, Don’t eat here unless you need something just “gluten friendly”. They cook the gluten free crust in the wheat flour in the oven!, The pizza crust was doughy and flavorless. I got 1 pepperoni for each slice of pizza. Nothing about this pizza was good and I would not go back., Not celiac friendly. Knew nothing about cross contamination and used the same sauce spoon on my gf crust. She offered to get a clean spoon but i had to explain it wouldnt make a difference unless it was a fresh container of sauce. She said lots eat here with no issues i just rolled my eyes., They have a “gluten friendly” pizza aka not celiac safe because it goes into the same oven. They do change their gloves and have a new tray for the pizza. They pizza is good and filling. I enjoyed it., They told us that they can’t guarantee that the pizza is completely gluten free, they called it gluten friendly., Not safe at all. There is flour everywhere and they don't use fresh utensils or anything for gluten free. They didn't seem to even try to keep it safe. I was sick for days - stay away, Gluten free pizza is available ( 12” inch; size of a regular pizza). The only thing is there is risk of cross contamination but they change their gloves at request., Although they have two options for GF crusts, one a GF flour crust and the other a cauliflower crust, they prepare the pizzas on the same work surface causing cross contamination. Fine for people reducing gluten in their diet but not safe for celiacs., The person starting our pizzas use the same utensils for a regular pizza as the gluten free pizza., In a colossal failure of marketing, Mod Pizza names their gluten-free crust GLUTEN FRIENDLY. It’s like naming a milkshake chocolate lover to designate that it’s vanilla. I can’t even say how annoying I find that, because my whole problem is that my body is decidedly unfriendly to gluten. They make no claims to serving gluten-free pizza, offering the standard disclaimer about being made in a facility that processed wheat, and it’s just as well because they don’t take precautions like changing their gloves or cleaning the area the way other places do. The crust itself is one of the larger gluten-free-ish crusts available in the area. I could easily make two meals out of it, as opposed to other single sized gluten-free crusts that always seem a little too big to eat in one sitting and too small to be two meals. The crust itself, as pretty much all gluten-free crusts tend to be, was bland. It was crispy in the edges and weirdly doughy in the center, given that it’s precooked. They have a wide variety of toppings and the veggies are really fresh. However, I ordered spinach on mine and watched in disbelief as the person in the line carefully distribute five tiny baby spinach leaves across the crust. The pizza cooks really fast, but vegetables like green pepper cake out completely raw while the edge of the crust was burnt. So far I’m not a fan, but it’s also a new location so maybe they need time to get the kinks worked out. But I prefer Piology who offers a thin crispy crust and an automatic glove change or &pizza, who changes their gloves and wipe down the counters and have a delicious Smart Flour crust. If only they would open a location a minute from my house!... Updated: because my kids’ school has a fundraiser here I ate here a second time. This time they changed their gloves when told I had a wheat allergy and took precautions. I ordered the Tristan with some extra veggies and it came out tasty and crispy, perhaps because they added the pesto sauce last. However, despite their precautions, my stomach was a little off today, so I still don’t consider it celiac safe. Still not the best, but has shown improvement., Access their menu online at www.peppertwins.comMany things are marked gluten free., Mod has great tasting pizza with a build-your-own concept. The problem is that depending on the person making your pizza, you will get little protection from cross-contamination. I had to stop the guy from using his flour-covered hands to pick up my gluten-free crust. They go through the motions of making it “safer” by having the crust in a separate location, changing gloves if asked, and using a different cutter for gf pizzas, but all the utensils used to spread sauces are the same as far as I could tell. If you aren’t very sensitive to gluten then you may be okay, but sadly, celiacs should stay very far away. The rating is a split between the gluten-free pizza being very tasty versus it not doing anywhere near enough to ensure that it’s safe to eat.","Leigha,Cayman,merilyn,AScott,Aimee,Nicole,William,Dreama,Jennifer,Rebecca ,Shel,Madison,Lance,Tami,Kristina,Hanna,Heather,Emily,Ashley,Gina,Alisa,Danielle,emily,Ashlee,Jonathan,Kelly D.,Alisha,Vanessa,Kris,Nina,Michelle,Paige,lexi tomlinson,GFhewert,suzanne,Rose,Angela,Denny,Hailee,Brittney,Ashlee,lindib89,Nicole,Derrick,kristen,Nastassia,Chris,EH,A,OptimaK,gfsmalltowngirl",CO,7,18,34,80230

You do need to ask for grill to be cleaned. On busy nights, the other food from other bowls do get close to each other (and my husband has had ingredients from other bowls show up in his due to this). I need GF, and I’ve never had an issue. Sauces are techno GF but I stay away from soy sauce based ones just to be safe, All sauces gluten free, they will clean the grill prior to cooking., HuHot does not have a gluten free menu but does have an allergen list and a list of gluten free sauces. Ask them to clean a spot on the grill and use different utensils, if necessary.... Mixed up family orders. 2 dishes were inedible., Even though they offer gluten free options. When my family ordered some meals, the orders were so mixed up and wrong that I will not trust them for gluten free food ever again.... Do not trust these people if you have Celiac desease., We love HuHot! All of their sauces are gf and they have so many different options. It’s definitely a favorite of ours!, This restaurant is so safe for people with food allergies! They take all the necessary safety precautions and more. When I sat down I talked to my server and I was pointed to a separate stack of yellow bowls that indicate to the chefs that you have food allergies. Every time I walked up to get my food cooked they already had the area prepared. They first clean the grill extra super well and check that I’m comfortable with it, they set out blockers to separate the grill from everyone else’s food, and they use compete separate serving/cooking tools.... It was amazing experience eating here. The chefs took above and beyond safety precautions. I never was left feeling weird or needy for needing extra safety precautions. The second time around of getting my food the grill was already prepared to the safety standard of what I need. I definitely recommend this place!, These people didn't even know what gluten or cross contamination was! It was advertised that they would get fresh food from the cooler and clean the grill, but they had no idea what they were doing! I had to leave, which was disappointing, because I had been looking forward to eating here., Server was very sweet & knowledgeable. She shared extra literature to assure I was selecting GF sauces and walked me through the process. You let the chef know and they double clean the grill right in front of you and use clean spatulas. Food was delicious!, Great awareness in preparing the food. The sauces are now confusing on whether they’re almost all safe, but I’m always able to find good stuff., I used to be able to eat here safely with sauces marked accordingly. I went today and noticed the sauces we not marked any longer but I wasn’t worried. I ate the normal ones I usually do. I immediately felt sick and got a headache, which has never happened. When I asked the manager she said they weren’t allowed to mark the products as gluten free. The manager was not clear on what was safe of gluten free. I have literally never been so sick in my life., Ask for the allergy bowls and they will go to a lot to keep your food safe. Safe sauces are NOT marked so do your research ahead of time., I have eaten here many times without getting sick. It is a buffet so there is a chance of cross contamination from the line, particularly around the noodles. Look carefully when you are collecting your noodles or ask the staff and they will grab you a fresh tray from the back to pull from. When you get to the grill, let them know you have an allergy and they will clean the grill for you and divide your food from the rest while cooking. If you communicate tour needs, the staff is always quite helpful!, Most of their food is gf, all the sauces are gf, and when you tell the cooks you are gf, they do extra cleaning of the grill and mark a spot off for your food and use clean spatulas. I have eaten there twice and have not had a reaction. The first waiter explained to me to not to eat the rice, soy sauce that's on the table, sausage, and crab. The pad thai noodles are gf. It's nice to still be able to eat what I like there., They have some bowls they will give you to notify the cooks that you have an allergy. They thoroughly scrubbed the grill and blocked off with spatulas to be sure. I didn’t get sick! Be cautious as the waitress said all the sauces were gf and then brought me the allergy menu. Most sauces had wheat in them but not gluten., Always enjoy our meal here— they SCRUB the grill and take great pains to minimize/eliminate cross contamination. All of their sauces are GF (though some have wheat that’s processed to be below the PPM threshold to be GF, so if celiac, it might be best to avoid those). 99% of their ingredients are GF, though I wish that they’d move the rice noodles away from the wheat noodles to prevent cross contamination (the staff will provide fresh ingredients if need be)., Three options. They even brought the package out to me so I can verify the ingredients., I’m not celiac but gluten sensitive, but was very impressed with the steps they took when I asked for gluten free options. I got a yellow bowl that was recognized while I was in line, and by the time I got to the grill they had already Brillo scrubbed, washed with water, and secluded an area with spatulas. As the cooks worked their way around the grill, they only used the unique spatulas reserved for my food. Very impressive. Next time I will make sure to get a regular bowl as these precautions are not necessary for me, but it was great to see and I wanted to share. Happy eating!, The staff is very knowledgeable. They clean off the grill well & use new, clean spatulas for allergy bowls! My dad (Celiac) loves eating here and (knock on wood) has never got sick., NOT Celiac friendly, or suitable for a wheat allergy at all! I went there and the manager came and explained how all their sauces are gluten free and they deep cleaned the grill and everything. I got extremely sick and checked their website. Apparently just about every sauce contains wheat, but they claim that it is fermented so it contains less than 20 ppm. I definitely wouldn't have trusted that if I had read it before hand. As far as cross contamination the noodles are at the beginning of the line so everything after has chance of touching gluten. Tasted great but NOT GF., Triple scrape the table for you, have a huge selection of gluten free. Was kind of worried, but I had a great time, I walked in and was ignored by the staff for several minutes, so I walked out. I haven’t tried the food, Cleaned a special spot on the grill for gluten-free area, and great food. kind of hard to tell on a sausage so we had to ask., Have a separate colored bowl to alert for allergy, cleaned grill well used clean utensils, This place is amazing when it comes to taking care of their GF customers. Yes a customer has to use common sense and read but the restraunt provides special bowls for those with allergies, scrubs the grill prior to an allergy order then they place a special section up to prevent cross contamination with other orders. Not all sauces are GF however they are all clearly marked so you don't get confused. Reading through some of these other reviews I just laugh. Clearly some just expect to be handed everything on platter. Anyone who has celiac disease knows you have to read and ask questions. Even then many people do not know what celiac disease is so you have to educate them. Huhot rocks. I have eaten here several times and never gotten sick., The staff was very knowledgeable and helpful. The waitress brought me special colored bowls in order to alert the chefs that I had an allergy. At the grill, they vigorously scrubbed a portion of it and placed spatulas around my food. Their nutritional information for their sauces are on their website. It was very good., Wow. The service was amazing. The manager offered to get the items for my order out of the prepped boxes in the back so I didn't have to go through the buffet line (a cc nightmare). He even oversaw the cleaning of the grill after telling the cooks it was an allergy order (I watched) and personally delivered the food. He also instructed and made sure they kept the orders separate and used clean utensils. I am celiac and had no reaction., Very good food and quite a fun experience. They have zucchini noodles or pad Thai noodles that are gf. The sauces are labeled and if you tell them it’s an allergy, they clean the grill off very well. I went with the peanut sauce and it was so good. had zero issues and I will be back. Don’t forget to join their club before you go!, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed their food. Have had it several times now, and even with takeout I never got sick from it! So many options to customize your dish with, and you get a very large portion for your money when they deliver. I wasn’t sure at first because it was a chain and buffet style, but it’s given me a chance to eat Asian style food again and I’m happy., This particular location has always been great with me, they have gluten free pasta and they moved it by the vegetables to avoid the gluten noodles from falling into it. At the grill if you tell them you have an allergy they do a good job of cleaning the area and giving your food it’s own blocked off space., This place is about making connections and being super polite and advocating for yourself. I went here with 3 gluten eaters. I told the waitress right away that I had celiac and she gave me the allergen menu, she told me her best friend was a celiac too and understood cross contamination. When it came time to grab my ingredients she went to the back for me with the list of items I wanted and grabbed them fresh. They then designated a spot in the grill, wiped it down really well- basically scoured it-and put up barriers so my food wouldn’t mingle with trouble. I did not get sick and it was so yummy!! if you do not advocate for yourself I can see how this restaurant could be trouble, hence the 4 stars., They do gluten free very well. Give them advice worring so they will clean the grill for you. They recently added breaded chicken to the buffet, so you have to watch for cross contamination. If you ask, they will give you your meat choices straight from the freezer., Most sauces contain wheat, but are processed to less than 20ppm gluten. Luckily there are plenty of fresh sauces that do not contain soy, like ginger and garlic juice, sesame oil, etc. ... I was given a bowl with a distinguishing color, so the cooks knew to keep my food separate and they always followed separate cooking protocols. All the staff knew what to do with food allergies, etc.... Dietary restrictions are easy to find on the corporate website., Perhaps because I was comparing to BDs Mongolian BBQ, I thought this place was mediocre. I don't like how thin they cut all the meat... It made it taste terrible and I couldn't even pierce the meat with my fork out was so thin. Not impressed., Dedicated allergy bowls. The clean off the grill really well this location places plates and spatulas and makes a barrier and uses just one set of spatulas for our gf food. The buffet. The rice noodles were not next to the regular ones so less chance of cc. The only thing I didn't like was the sauces are not marked. I didn't check for a list as we have been enough at ours back home that we knew what was save for sure., The process was a little confusing at first but worked out great in the end. It would have been a 5 start but I had to wait awhile for service and the rest of my party eat without me. There was confusion about whether I ordered at the table but then I was told that I go to the line and someone would meet me and walk me through the fresh topping containers to avoid all cross contamination. They put me in line quickly at grill station and cleaned the grill super well. I was super impressed! Those guys work hard and did a great job cleaning it. I enjoyed my meal and had no issues or sickness. I would eat there again!, Excellent staff, very knowledgeable! Cooks prepared the grill for allergies & changed spatulas before I even walked up twice!, I do HuHot often!! Always delicious... cooks are always very cautious and keep my food separate with separate utensils, They brought me their allergy list, then had me write down what I wanted. They proceeded to go to the back and put my chosen ingredients together from the back where they would be safe from cross contamination. When it came time to cook it they cleaned a safe area on the grill, grabbed clean utensils and kept my food safe., Very Celiac Friendly! Tell the server you have a food allergy- they should give you a special bowl (yellow) to go through the lone that tells the cooks that you have a food allergy. Ask for the allergy sheet- it tells you exactly which items have wheat in them. I took the sheet up with me as I created my meal. A couple employees checked in with me as well. When we got to the grill they scrubbed it clean for my food and set up plates and spatulas around my food to protect it. They also used new spatulas to cook the food. Amazing experience!!, The sauces are most likely cross contaminated because when you scoop
sauce with a ladle, it drips in all of the sauces on the way to your bowl. The gf sauces are not kept away from the others, unfortunately., Staff were very helpful when I told them I had Celiac disease. I was immediately given a menu with the food allergens of each ingredient, a yellow bowl which designated I had a food allergy, and personal assistance from the staff as I assembled my bowl. When I got to the grill, they thoroughly scrubbed the grill and checked with me to ensure I was comfortable with the cleanliness. The food was perfectly cooked and very tasty. I had no ill effects from contamination. I would recommend this restaurant to others with similar conditions., We had a reaction after eating at this HuHot. Had to be cross contamination of some kind. Staff was not as knowledgeable as our local Cedar Falls HuHot., Sauces I can have: sweet and sour only
Soups. Egg drop. Lots of choices. Allergen menu is clear., They are amazing for allergies. They ultra clean the blazing hot grill with a metal screen and scrub for at least 5 minutes until its cleanly washed with no residue. They give a special colored bowl and it takes a little longer but so worth it. All sauces are gluten free except the straight soy sauce. They are great., Good GF selection! Tell your server you have an allergy... want something from the line, but afraid it might be contaminated? Ask for it from the back, they’ll bring you what you want! They also have a list of GF sauces, but you have to ask for it., So dirty, no gluten free notations, food and sauces intermixed- when I questioned things staff said they don’t eat here, I would give 0 stars if I could, If you tell them you are gluten free when you hand them your bowl, they will thoroughly clean the surface and portion it off from others. Sauces are labeled with gf and non gf., Fresh, delicious, and knowledgeable about dietary needs including celiac. They have signs on the gf buffet items and a system for signaling the cooks, who then clean an area of the grill right in front of you and section your food off from everything else., Wait staff asked if any allergies and they will provide a yellow bowl to alert chefs to clean cooking area beforehand., If you have celiac this place is a cross contamination nightmare. All of the ingredients are laid out buffet style, you grab a bowl and put in what you would like. All of the ingredients end up everywhere and who knows if people are leaving the tongs in their respective containers. Same with the sauces section. I think it’s labeled with what is gluten free but who is to say someone didn’t accidentally drip something? Then you continue down the line where your food is cooked in front of you on a huge circular thing. Your area is cleaned (I think with soap but I’m not entirely sure) and then cooked right next to the rest of the food... I went here as a new celiac so my reaction was mild but I’m sure if I went back now being gluten free for almost two years, i would be out for weeks. If you have celiac stay away., The staff here was amazing attention to every detail making sure my food wasn’t contaminated. Stay away from the pasta section of the Buffett and you have a great new safe place to eat ! They were the most professional and outgoing making me feel like it was my life that really counts !, If you get it with rice its gluten free. Just make sure to ask the chef to wash the grill twice.","Leigha,marti,Elizabeth,jik,Regan,Kian,Sabrina,Angela,Kim,Beth,Carmen,Erin J,Tina,K,Ellysbelly,Lisa,Caitlin Mac Nair,Sarah,Jenn,Jake,Celeste,Dman,TMJ,Lori,Delia Ann,Audrey,GFJenni,KayaMarie5,Nicole,Jessica P,Chester,Cassandra,Melissa,Pamela,Nelson Ohana,Jennifer,Mindy,Breanna,Danielle,ELE,Paula,Angela,mom,Sharynn,Sara,Sandy,JulieMcG,Harmony,Sarah,Chrystal,Billie,Ariel",CO,22,6,38,80238

Takes a bit longer (so allow more time if doing an online order to pick up), but worth it for the reassurance., I’ve eaten here 3 times and the last 2 times I got sick, I will not be going back. Cross-contamination is a big issue here., Separate workstation to build sandwich, with separate utensils. Allergy protocol there is taken seriously by staff.
I’ve had subs from there several times and have never felt sick.
Good bread too!, Asked if it was gluten allergy or preference and took precautions including changing gloves and preparing in separate, cleaned space., Great gf options. They clean the grill and change gloves., Order here regularly. I let them know up front and they do a good job wiping down to make sandwiches. Glad to find a place I can have a quick sub sandwich, Staff is great! Eaten from here multiple times without any issues. I’ve seen them put together my sandwich and they’re very careful not to contaminate anything., They offer gluten free bread in all sizes. They ask if it’s allergy or preference when you order gf bread. If it’s allergy they automatically change gloves or ask if you’d prefer it. They take some precautions to ensure the space they use and the knife they cut with is clean. Because their sauces come from a squeeze bottle and are not spread on, there’s little chance for cross contamination from the ingredients., Offer GF sub rolls for all sandwiches. When I mentioned a gluten allergy, they cleaned the slicer, used new utensils, put the sandwich on paper, and put on new gloves. Very knowledgeable about cross contamination. One suggestion - ask them to heat the GF bread before making your sandwich., I always love jersey mikes cause they do the gf prep in front of you, and they clean and take it seriously, I watch them open the bread from a separate area, and put it on a mini cutting board! The prep is great, and I never have stomach aches. I think it’s a great place for lunch!, Love Jersey Mike's. The staff is trained so well, they clean the slicer and surfaces, separate utensils, change gloves etc. The food is always fresh and tastes great. I've had both hot and cold subs and I've never had an issue and I'm a super sensitive Celiac., We like that they offer GF bread now, just wish there was a kids menu option too., Udi bread is used. Changed gloves and staff new difference between gluten free and gluten free for an allergy., Excellent service. This location is new and well gladly do special and gluten free orders. Beware the "" juice"" is made of red vinegar and olive oil but the olive oil is half soybean oil. If u have an allergy to soy leave their ""olive oil"" off ur sandwich, Sandwiches have not disappointed. Bread is really tasty and all the various cheesesteaks are our favorite, Unsure... My favorite gf sand which place. Severe celiacs and never had a problem. Delicious!, Negligent and doesn't pay attention to details in notes, I enjoy the turkey & cheese sub when my office orders lunch from Jersey Mikes. It’s nice to be able to order with the group! I’ve never had a reaction., When we told them it was GF they all changed their gloves and wiped everything down, Wow very very impressed. The whole staff knew everything about gluten cross contamination and whelpful in answering questions. They took me very seriously and changed gloves, changed the cutting board, used a dedicated gluten free knife, sliced a new tomato for me, and were in general just very impressive. Did not get sick and am sensitive.... Will definitely be back!... They can do basically any sandwiych GF... Great staff. Will be back!!!, Ordered pickup and my wife grabbed my sandwich. GF bread was good enough, and the sub was excellent!, It's covid so I couldn't stand in there and watch them make it, but I ordered through the app, put a ton of notes asking them to change gloves etc. And I didn't get sick so in my celiac mine they're winners., Horrible service! The staff COMPLETELY lacks knowledge in celiac disease/gluten allergy and cross contamination. When I asked for a gluten free menu the guy points to the bread and says, ""all we have is gluten free bread."" I ask about fresh veggies as I can tell they don't utilize utensils and I was told what they have out is all they have. The guy explained they clean the machine that cuts the meat and they have gluten free bread but that was all. If you have celiac disease or a severe gluten sensitivity I would not eat here, They will clean the grill, change gloves, wipe down counters and keep your sandwich on paper the whole time in case they missed anything when they wiped down.... Everything is freshly made, Imagine paying $4 extra for gf bread. Foh, My husband is celiac and they poisoned him here. It happened only once, but we will not trust Jersey Mike's ever again after this. They do use the same grill as the gluten food and we've seen them clean it before cooking our food, but the guy there that night I guess wasn't trained properly. Shouldn't have to babysit their workers. Do not eat here if celiac... Very poor since not celiac safe, Staff changed their gloves and prepared sandwich on new paper to prevent cross contamination.... Most sandwiches are available gluten free with their special bread.... I would go here again for gluten free., Manager made my sandwich and took care to change his gloves and use a clean tray and knife. They did wipe down the meat slicer to be safe.... Was not able to have the sandwich warmed up because they use the microwave for so many other things.... Restaurant was clean. They are doing the social distancing in the COVID-19 requirements., They were very busy today when we stopped in but they did a great job of making sure everything was celiac safe! Great job thank you!, Separate kitchen space... Great customer service, separate prep area and use of utensils. Very careful. We never get sick and love the cheesesteaks!!!, They did a poor job cleaning off equipment and then used the same mayonnaise and knife as everyone else. We ended up just taking our son to Kroger to pick out something safe rather than let him get sick ☹, Clean the slicer before use, change gloves, wash hands before prepping gf order.... Almost all the subs can be made with the gf bread.... Very informed employees and friendly and eager to help, They clean surfaces, utensils, wash hands and get new gloves, clean slicer etc for all GF orders... I think all subs can be made on GF bread (Udi’s), They offer udis gluten free buns and udis gluten free cookies. I got the gluten free veggie sandwich & I did not get sick. They wash all counter tops and change gloves and clean utensils (have a dedicated gf knife to cut bread) before handling gluten free food... Most sandwiches can be made gluten free, Tested a GF steak and cheese with a Nima gluten sensor and it tested positive for gluten. Not confident in staff’s ability to mitigate cross contamination.... Have had great past experiences but the most reason was contaminated. Try at your own risk, will not be ordering again in the future.... Had great past experiences. Unfortunately the most recent, I ordered a GF steak and cheese and tested it on the Nima gluten sensor. The sub tested positive for gluten. Not confident in the staff’s ability to mitigate cross contamination despite being told it was an allergy., Have been multiple times and they always clean off the surfaces and change their gloves to avoid cross contamination. They are knowledgeable and are always happy to help., They were so accommodating...the girl that helped me went to the back and got the veggies and mayo from the back (so no cross contamination). She also cut the meat and cheese on a separate slicer. They also have gluten free bread. Best sandwich I have had in years!!!, Awesome staff a decent sandwich., Very careful about cross contamination., Informed staff I was celiac, asked about there allergy protocols. Staff told me they can accomodate and have a seperate line for making food. I ordered my sandwich asking for gluten free bun...he relayed the order to someone else. They prepped my sandwich on a back line(I couldnt see) adding toppings from the front line to mine, they had a seperate knife and everything. Got home...was the same bread as my husbands which is not gluten free., Celiac friendly. I have eaten here several times and I've never had a reaction. Just ask for gluten free bread and they will ask if it's by choice or allergy. If you tell them allergy, they take it to the back and prepare it in a separate location., When ordering gluten free they clean the entire area including the slicer. They changed gloves and got all ingredients from the back. They have gluten free bread and keep it completely separate from the regular bread.... Any sandwich can be made gluten free and the gluten free bread is pretty good. They have chips and sometimes individually package gluten free cookies., I am celiac and never had an issue. They use certified gluten free bread (Udis). They ask if you have an allergy and they change out gloves/utensils and make the sandwich in a dedicated gf station., I haven’t eaten in restaurant due to covid so I am not sure what safety precautions they take. I ordered a sandwich on the gluten free bread and though I didn’t get sick I can’t say I really enjoyed my meal. The bread they use is the worse gluten free bread I’ve had. It was super dry and thick but also didn’t hold up at all. Basically from the first bite the whole bread flaked into a million pieces and I had to chug water cause it was so dry. So yes they offer gluten free bread and I assume it’s pretty safe to eat but other than the meats and veggies it’s not very good., One person stayed w the order instead if passing it. Wiped down everything, including the slicer. Alerted rest of staff he was doing gluten free. This has been process each time I’ve eaten here.... Udi’s bread was a bit too much, maybe hollow out a bit before eating. Even had gf cookies and chips were good.... Amazing. Almost any sub can be gf. Bread was softer and they even have Udi’s cookies. They were all very careful about cross contamination., Used to work at a Jersey Mikes before I was diagnosed. There are no dedicated gluten free zones and bread touches almost all the surfaces so I don’t trust it","Leigha,kristy,Amber Eichorn,Catie,Megan,Dave,Mardianne,Kelly,Joey,Marc,Christina,GlutenStinks15,Cecilia&Daniel,Nicole,Jackie,kymaaera,Angelica Lopez,Max,Allison,Michele,Jessica,joshmagner,sh1234,TJ,Kristine,Chelsea,Hannah,Cameron ,Lisa,Matt,Lory Breckler,Terry,lucinka,Karan Anne,Howard,Michelle,Rylie,PCapstick,Tyler,Barbra,Anthony,User,Bobbie,Robert,nikki,Darryl,Maria,Ama Burns,Kian,Jaime,Sarah",CO,5,2,36,80238

Only meat option that has gluten is the sausage. Such good cheese bread!, All their meats are gf! They also have house brand Pinot Noir, sides, and cheese rolls that are fine!, I have successfully enjoyed dinner here 3 times without any issues. I would say it is very Celiac friendly., This place was amazing! There were so many choices to choose from. All meats at this location are Gluten free and delicious. Also most thing on the salad bar as well. They even have cheese bread that is Gluten free. And you can even finish your meal off with dessert as they have two that are Gluten free ., Plenty of Gluten Free options! Dinner was 5 star and I will be back. ... No reaction or sensitivity, The options on the salad bar are amazing! They even bring you a basket of mini cheese bread(gf). They have a list of allergies of several types and is a giant A+ on my Denver list! The food is truly amazing and worth the price!, I've been eating at this place in Utah for yrs and was really excited to find one here.
It is slightly different with covid restrictions but still so worth it., Gluten free cheese bread, Jasmine rice, and fried banana. Gluten free creme brulee. It was awesome!, The food here was terrible and overpriced! With the facade of a fancy restaurant, they served canned beans, bland cheese, and raw vegetables. Definitely not vegetarian friendly, but they have a lot of meat —which we didn’t try because the salad buffet was terrible so we didn’t feel like paying double to eat meat. There are gluten free options, but the food is simply not worth paying for. I don’t understand the hype at all!!, Great place for gluten free! If you ask, they have an allergen list. The meats are all gluten free, and many things at the buffet (salad, potato salad, tomatoes, rice, and a TON of other options) are also gluten free. I’d definitely ask for the sheet of gluten vs non gluten free foods to get specifics but there are many options (although less so for vegetarian). I ate twice here since it was close by and did not get sick either time! Lunch is cheaper than dinner but the selection of meats is slightly different and more limited, but it was still great!, Terrific food. As others have noted, all the meats are gluten free and the staff takes care to show you what is safe on the salad bar. I took one star away, though, because none of the salad dressings were gluten free, which really limited the salad bar options, Great food, parts of salad bar our unsafe but manager immediately let me know everything I could eat. Totally recommend., Had a great experience. I am Very sensitive to cross contamination and did not get sick! Very celiac friendly cooking process., Meats are gluten free and most of the salad bar is also. Last year when we went here the manager walked me through everything they offer to let me know what I could safely enjoy. Tonight when we went back there, I informed the waitress I cannot have gluten, and she proceeded to bring things out. At the end of the meal after watching me eat the whole dish of mashed potatoes she informed me that they were not gluten free although they were in the past. I'm currently sitting in bed with a reaction on my anniversary. Very inconsistent here. Be careful., I have eaten here several times. Most of the salad bar is gluten free. The chef will come out and walk you around to tell you what is safe and what is not. The meats are all gluten free., The staff was very knowledgeable. I talked to the manager. She said that she used to have a server that had celiac and would eat the Brazilian bread all the time. It was really good. And the Pincanha steak was so yummy!
There are a couple of side dishes that have gluten so it’s not 100% gf. I would definitely go again, The manager was so helpful. He walked me through the buffet line to describe what I could eat. Service was great! They even offer a discount for teachers, police officers and EMTs. I will definitely go back., Celiac friend was pleased with the experience., Awesome! All meat was gluten free and the cheese buns are gluten free and delicious. Fabulous meal!, I ate there and it was delicious. Didn’t get glutened. However, the staff did not walk me through the salad bar. My waitress gave me a sheet of the GF options but the salad bar items were not labeled. A manager went through the salad bar with me once I asked. ... The tabbouleh contains gluten and it was next to the GF mozzarella balls. I found pieces of tabbouleh in the mozzarella for example. I’m a new Celiac so I’m sure this is very common. ... The meat is GF and the fried bananas and cheese bread. I ate a lot of those ;), Ask the manager to walk you through the bar, they are EXTREMELY knowledgable about celiac and cross contamination. I was able to eat the bread which was my favorite part!!!, 5 Star service, friendly knowledgable staff, individual attention to allergies for celiac. The food was delicious, service outstanding !!, Manager walks you around the salad bar and lets you know what is safe and what isn’t. The Brazilian cheese bread is great! All meat is safe. Fun atmosphere., This restaurant was such a delightful surprise! All meats gluten free and the salad bar was phenomenal. Salad dressings gluten free. Manager walked me through gluten containing items. Mashed potatoes were not gluten free but bread and bananas were. Even had 3 gluten free desserts., First time at this location. Third time at a Texas de Brazil overall. Always a good experience. All the meats are gluten free. Most of the salad bar is. The cheese bread roll things they bring to everyone's table are gluten free. The manager and our waiter checked a few items with the executive chef (fancy title!) to confirm they were gluten free. They have a few desserts, too. Crème brulé, passion fruit ice cream, and Carmel flan. Check out their website. Pretty sure it's listed there. Delicious food. Always leave stuffed!, The staff will give you a personalized tour of the salad bar and tell you what foods you need to avoid. Staff very knowledgeable about gluten. Large amount of food available that is gluten free., Would totally recommend this place! They are very knowledgeable and if you ask them, you can get extra wishes. So I just asked to get the Potato Casserole without the sauce, so just fried potatoes and they pulled it of no questions asked. They also have several GF desserts (flan, crème brulée etc)., All the meat is gluten free. If you need more information than that, you shouldn't go here. It's $70 or more per person, so go hungry and don't worry about any of the sides. The meat is delicious, so I imagine the other food is, but I don't know because I've only eaten the meat, as should you., I usually save 5 stars for dedicated GF restaurants but I'm making an exception. The manager told me they try to make it easy for GF patrons to eat there as he escorted me around the salad bar and told me just what I could and couldn't have. There were a handful of items on the salad/charcuterie bar that weren't GF, and only one side dish was GF. The mashed potatoes that came with the meal experience were not GF but the bread was fresh Brazi Bites that were amazing. ALL of the meats (15 meats are brought to your table) were GF. It's so nice to have a place to go for a nice occasion that gives more than a couple of choices and that I can be confident I won't get sick from. I can't wait to go back., Their food is incredible! The Manager will walk you around their huge salad bar to show you what is safe to eat. Almost all the meats are GF as well! Bring your appetite as it’s all you can eat. Well worth the price!, Unreal. Almost all is GF including cheese bread. Three GF desserts too!! Our waiter gave me a GF tour so I would know exactly what I could eat! Amazing and worth the money!, They tell you that the meat is gluten-free however I got really sick. I just eat the meat, I think the put some sauce that contain gluten or there is a contamination some where, This place is awesome!! Once you tell them you have allergies, they give you a paper with all allergies and a list of their food and let you know if it has dairy or gluten. This way you can eat only what you can. The food was amazing! If your celiac and Dairy free like me this is a good place., Fantastic Brazilian style steakhouse/buffet. Most of the items (including the cheese bread) is gluten free!, Amazing. The server walked me through the salad bar for safe options. Basically the hot stuff on the salad bar is not safe but I wouldn’t waste the space in my stomach when the meat is so awesome. The GF bread is really good but don’t each too much. Safe space for the meat., The manger himself walked me through the sides/ salad area to identify which items were GF. All meat is prepared GF, Texas de Brazil has a lot of gluten free options and a nice atmosphere. When I arrived, I explained my gluten free needs and the manager took me around and showed me all the gluten free items on their salad bar. In addition, all of the meats that are brought to the table are gluten free and the bread balls brought to the table are also gluten free (made from Yuca flour). The meal was delicious and it was nice being able to eat what everyone else was eating - and a lot of it. I left full and satisfied. They had creme brûlée for dessert that was just ok.
$$$, Amazing experience here! Cheese bread was gluten free and they brought out an allergy list. All the meats were gluten free and most of the salad bar. Great service and great food., No GF menu, but manager came to my table to discuss the food. He took me on a walk around the salad bar and pointed out what had gluten. All meats are GF and there’s a gf cheesy bread too. Great service, delicious food., The food is excellent. But last time I was here the manager assured me that all the sides were gf. This time, the manager says the potatoes aren't. That kind of inconsistency makes this a place I don't trust anymore., Very knowledgeable staff! :) they were super kind and accommodating. They even got me a delicious creme brulee because it was my anniversary. I ate the meats, rolls, and bananas as well. I ignore the salad bar because you get so much food without it and I don't want to risk cross contamination. It is a fun dining experience and very safe for celiacs because I am a super sensitive. 10/10, This restaurant is fantastic! Make sure to reserve a table ahead of time through OpenTable App or by calling them because it can get quite busy. Once you're seated, let the waitress know you have a gluten intolerance. A manager will come out and show you which foods at the salad bar you can eat. He'll then explain which meats you can have. The manager & staff is very knowledgeable!... BACKGROUND on the restaurant: this is a high end steak house. They continually serve you with different meats and there's an unbelievably delicious salad bar that comes with with the meal. It's $50/person, before drinks and desert, but it's all you can eat and incredibly good food. Come hungry!, Chef card out and walked me through the salad bar. All the meats are gf, as are the rolls, white rice and beans. Lots of salad and veggie options as well, Great dinner, very knowledgeable. Manager personally met with us and showed what was safe and what was not. Expensive but a wonderful dining experience., The manager came out and spoke to us. We had a delicious meal, bread and dessert. Great experience., Very knowledgeable! All the meat was GF and a large amount of the salads/buffet bar were too. A bit questionable about buffet bar since it wasn’t in separate areas but mostly stuck to the meat & had no problems!, Absolutely fabulous. The meat was unreal. Everything on our table tasted great. Plus gluten free BREAD?!? I read reviews where people said the bread isn't gf and i swear it is. I asked the manager who took me around the restaurant and said what i could and could not eat. She said the bread is made of starch (i read somewhere that it is tapioca starch). The bananas were so good i ate maybe 4 of them lol. My boyfriend said we should go back tomorrow so it is definitely carnivore man approved. ;)
Be prepared to spend some money ($100+) but the experience is well worth it. If you are a sensitive celiac like me no need to fear here.
You can't eat the mashed potatoes they serve at the table and some things at the salad bar. I just avoided the salad bar completely and loaded up on meat, bread, and bananas., We went here for our anniversary. The food was good as normal, except, the cheese bread is no longer gluten free. Such a disappointment! I loved going somewhere where I could have bread. I hope corporate reconsiders this horrible decision!, I had a great experience. Very educated staff and manager even stopped by to confirm., As of early 2018, their bread rolls are no longer gluten free and we weren't told until we directly asked. Please be careful and ask about everything. We come here annually and were quite surprised of the change., Excellent food- excellent service. My wife is very sensitive and we both enjoy eating here., Staff knew exactly what I couldn’t and couldn’t have from the salad bar. All meat was gluten free and the bread for the table was gluten free. The food was amazing. Will for sure be going back., Almost everything at this restaurant is naturally gluten-free, including all of the meats, and the bread that they put on the table. I asked the waiter to walk me through what I could eat at the salad bar, and he brought out the maitre'd, he was extremely knowledgeable, and walked me through the entire salad bar. Each item at the salad bar has its own serving utensil, so cross-contamination is really not an issue. There are very few items on the menu that contain gluten., What a great place to eat gluten free! You can call and let them know you are gluten free, they will mark your ticket and a chef or manager will come out and show you the whole list of gluten free foods. Almost all of their salad bar is gf, all the meat, and especially the little cheese bread balls that come out to the table! The bread balls are made with tapioca flour and are amazing. Our service was great and I left full and satisfied !, No issues. Expensive but great special occasion restaurant. Manager walked me through the salad bar to explain which foods to avoid.

I walked in and said I have Celiac Disease and the person who took my order immediately changed gloves and cleaned counter. Chipotle is my go-to when traveling. Never disappoint, I had no issues at this location. The woman at the front of the counter changed her gloves for me and placed everything on my order instead of sending down the line., Chipotle does not have a gluten free menu but instead has a list of gluten-containing ingredients to avoid. Cross-contamination is a concern, however, so let the person taking your order know that you are gluten free and if you need them to take the proper precautions.
From their website: ""If you avoid gluten, don't eat our flour tortillas. If you are highly sensitive to gluten and would like us to change our gloves, just let us know at the start of your order. You should be aware items containing corn, including corn tortillas (chips, soft corn, and crispy corn tortillas) and corn salsa, may have a small amount of gluten from potentially co-mingling with gluten-containing grains in the field.""... Chipotle is one of my ""go to"" places. I visited this location while in town and it was great., Traveling with celiac can be emotionally draining. I walked in and asked if they were familiar with what gluten is, no hesitation and was answered yes, gloves off, hands washed, new gloves on and started changing utensils. All the employees seemed to know how to handle things to keep me safe. A thank you to the employees there is not really enough as the same restaurant down the road looked at me like I was crazy when I asked about gluten free options. Great lunch with great service, can’t beat that!😊, They’re always willing to Change gloves and I feel safe eating there., I always get sick from this place. I mention my allergy and they change their gloves/ get separate spoons but they put the spoons in the same main containers.... their chips are NOT gluten free. They told me they were and I got very sick not educated at all apparently, Had no clue what gluten free is despite their menu offering a gluten free tortilla or taco shell., Every filling is gf.
The only thing not gf is the tortilla. Which is sad because real tortilla are made from corn not wheat.
Take the bowl then, Will wash hands, change gloves and use disposable scoopers if you inform them of your ""allergy."" Everything is gluten free except for the burrito wraps. The shredded cheese and lettuce is grabbed with their gloves so it would be cross contaminated. They will get fresh from the back if you ask. I just try to avoid going when it's busy as to not hold up the line. 🤷🏼, I asked them to change gloves because of an allergy to the tortilla. He immediately dropped the tortilla he was holding directly over top of the rice containers. Then washed his hands, changed gloves and grabbed the empty tortilla wrapper. He crumpled it up threw it away and then asked if I wanted a fresh tortilla and opened the new tortillas..... Need I say more?, i found a long strand of hair in my burrito and the rice was definitely undercooked, i could taste how hard some rice were. the meat was dry and too bland. everything was too salty and i couldnt even finish my food. TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!, They refused to serve me, citing cross-contamination. I even emailed their headquarters. They said no.... They refused to serve me, citing cross-contamination. I even emailed their headquarters. They said no.... They refused to serve me, citing cross-contamination. I even emailed their headquarters. They said no., Most things here are naturally gf, and staff will change gloves if asked.... Bowls, tacos, and salads can be gf, as are chips and even the queso, Many delicious gluten free options, I have been going to this location for years and have never had an issue with an employee not changing their gloves and wiping down the counter... Just say you have a gluten allergy and they will go change gloves!, We travel alot and give Chipotle for a quick easy meal. I am C but say gluten allergy for ease of explanation. They changed gloves. Were very helpful and kind., I got sick, not celiac friendly, Wipe down the counters/where they make the food, change gloves, utensils, and get fresh toppings specifically for allergies... quality and quantity is about the same as if someone wasn’t ordering gluten free... Manager trained a new worker right in front of me and he was extremely knowledgeable and careful about cross contamination., DO NOT GET CHEESE ! I repeat do not get cheese. Even if employees change gloves the cheese is still extremely contaminated. Watch the employees hands as they make someone's food. The first thing they do is touch a tortilla with their glove. The last thing they do is touch the cheese WITH THEIR GLOVE., Always have been knowledgeable and changed gloves and pulled food from fresh containers to avoid cross contamination when informed., Stopped by on our way to South Dakata. They did a great job with preparing my food safely!, When I was here and mentioned I had celiac, staff wiped everything down, took out old spoons from the containers, washed hands/changed gloves, then put got clean utensils and new lettuce. Didn’t even have to ask them to change gloves or get new utensils! Very well trained!, Chipotle ALWAYS gets it right! They wash hands, change gloves, switch utensils, & inform all of the staff down the line! They’re the best & ROCK SOLID for a celiac, especially during travel!... Corn based & fantastic! The only flour in the kitchen is the large burrito wraps, all else is GF!... Eating here is 100% safe, 100% of the time🔥, The only thing with gluten here is the tortillas. Get a bowl, and you won't have any problems at all. I've gone many times without even mentioning my allergy with no problems at all., Most of the time I don’t even have to explain. I just say that I have celiac and they change their gloves and get clean spoons. And they don’t touch the serving spoon to anyone’s food.... The only thing that has gluten is the tortilla.... It’s my go to place for lunch or dinner, Love this place! It’s my favorite fast food place to go to because the only thing that isn’t gf is their flour tortillas., No precautions taken at all. If you wait in line and watch them, it’s basically gluten city. Asking them to change gloves (or put some on because they often don’t wear any) is irrelevant because they touch the flour tortillas with all utensils and allow everything to contact other items. Frequently they’ll overfill and put an ingredient BACK in the tray. So there’s massive x-contamination. DANGER!, They have gloves on and a plexiglass in front of the food and during this crisis they have masks on at all times... You can have a bowl with the same toppings as a burrito, This is seriously the most conscientious Chipotle I have ever eaten in. I live nearby and eat here about once a month. They change all the spoons, wipe down the counter and get out fresh lettuce for me. I have never gotten sick at this location. They are the best. Just let them know before you order and they will take care of you. I am not celiac but very sensitive., They did not change their gloves. Told me they ran out of separate toppings. Same work space... It May have just been this location because usually all chipotles are a safer option, but they told me they ran out of toppings and just threw what they could in my bowel. The same toppings that were touched by flour tortillas and I’m sure there was cross contamination! Truly disappointing! 1 Star, Staff didn’t know what to do . Needed to be asked to put in clean gloves and reminded to use clean utensils. The last time I went to this location I thought they were knowledgeable and did a nice job. Today’s crew had not been trained properly. Also their COVID-19 precautions were very lax. Masks worn improperly or around their necks. Probably won’t be back.... Their COVID-19 precautions were very lax. Masks worn improperly or around their necks. Probably won’t be back., Honestly, I’ve gotten sick eating here twice mostly because I do not think the staff cared about my allergy. Only at a few bites and got sick quick. I ordered according to their online menu that was GF, They do wipe down the counters and change their gloves after washing their hands. They take out the condiments straight from the bag below the buffet style service., The staff was polite and changed gloves when I ordered my rice bowl. However, I noticed as they made someone else's burrito that the serving spoons touched the flour shell and then they put the spoon back in the container. I got extremely sick and suspect it was from cross contamination on the spoons., I have a very sensitive gluten intolerance and every time I try their food I get my symptoms... Only on their website/ nutrition info you can find gluten free information, They are very nice and will always change gloves when asked. I have never in my life gotten sick, and I have eaten here a lot.... If you eat here you cannot get a burrito or a taco, but you can get a bowl! The bowls have all the same stuff that the burritos and tacos have, except for the shell/wrap/tortilla. Everything they put inside the food is gluten free. The chips are also all gluten-free corn chips., They do use flour wraps. But if you tell the worker you are gluten free they will change their gloves, change the spoons, and should also change the lettuce and cheese containers since they stick their hands in with the gluten gloves... Very yummy of course. Gone here for years., Kudos to the manager who upon learning that one of the meals was for a celiac (gluten free) person stepped in and with GREAT personal and serving care assured that there was no cross contamination. 5 Stars for the extraordinary care that was exercised, Workers will change gloves, wash hands, wipe down counter, and bag meals separately. They are compliant and very kind!... Everything at Chipotle is gluten free except the tortillas., Everything at Chipotle is gluten free except the flour tortillas. I LOVE having so many choices!!!, They’ve definitely gone downhill. Last time I got their food, it wasn’t very good (dry chicken, missing ingredients) and I was sick afterwards for several days. Can no longer recommend, I love chipotle! They never disappoint, they always give you a good amount of food. I usually get a bowl and most items on their menu are gluten free and celiac safe., The folks working here were super conscientious about changing gloves, wiping the counter, and using new tongs when I told them of my gluten allergy. The food was great and I feel great!, Cross contamination is high if they don’t change gloves or use fresh utensils. Not Celiac safe. Informed them of this but my meal had evidence of other salsas and meat, so it appears utensils were not changed even though requested. Stopped eating as soon as saw this but still having gluten reaction, Will change gloves, wash hands, and get separate cheese and lettuce if you ask. It really depends on the person you get when you order though. I’ve had both really good and really bad experiences. Most of the time the workers are very friendly but I’ve had a few of the workers get visibly irritated when I tell them I have celiacs.... The food is always good. I love getting the rice bowls and they’re fantastic.... I would give it 5 starts if some of the employees weren’t so rude. A few get visibly upset when they have to wash their hands and change their gloves. It’s just an unsettling feeling when they’re making your food and it’s honestly just really rude., Delicious clean ingredients and they’ll change their gloves and spoons if you tell them you’re gluten free., I've eaten at other chipotles and been ok, but I'm having a major wheat reaction this morning. It's possible it's one of my other sensitivities, but none of them give me this reaction that I know of. ... When I ordered, I told the server about my restrictions. He didn't change his gloves like I've seen at other franchises, nor replace the serving utensils. Like an idiot, I didn't ask him to because I didn't anticipate it being a big deal. And I didn't want to make his life harder during the pandemic. But... Ow., Will wash hands and change gloves if you ask.","Alberto,Shellie,Sara,JW,Mic,Keena,merilyn,Lauren,Marcduf,Kassie,Mark,Luna,Marsha,Meghan,Leanne,Caleb ,Monique,Katie,aanya,Wil,Ttomeo,Mike,Elizabeth,Marcie Ellen,Zach,Krista,Amelia,Joey,Lucy,Corbin,KarenW,Breanna,chris,LeeAnna Collier,Madalyn,Michelle,Courtney,Sarah,LaÉabha,Brenna Tkac,Tom,Nora,Jenny,Suzanne,Maia,Celia,Amy,JillianKara,Talia,jennifer,K,sophie herrema",CO,5,2,36,80202

Gluten Free Buns, Some Hard Rock locations have a gluten free menu but some do not. Please check the particular location you are interested in.... 26/08/2020
This place has gluten free menu, prices are quite high but food quality is excellent ., Waitress was very knowledgeable! They air fry fries to keep them separate... overall not bad! Service was lovely!, The burger and fries are great. We love to visit Hard Rock whenever we are in town. The servers have always been great., Everything we had was delicious., I was very impressed with this Hard Rock, which I cannot day for all Hard Rocks. When I said I was celiac, the chef and manager came out. They went through all their safety precautions in the kitchen and reviewed all of our orders against their allergen menu. Most of the food is made in house, so they can adapt. Plus the food was amazing. I highly recommend for safety and taste., The waiter was well informed. I had no concerns. There was a great selection on the menu and the barbecue burger was great. The fries are gluten-free. I’m celiac and did not get sick afterwards., Waitress was knowledgeable on gf options and they have a gf menu available and seperate frier for fries. Food was great. Gf bun is crumbly which may be a deal breaker for some but not an issue for me., Gluten Free menu available upon request. Great selection of meals. My daughter went for the burger - and really enjoyed the GF bun!!, The staff handled my celiac allergy very well. Waitress was knowledgeable. Best news ever— they bake their fries so I could finally eat GF fries!! Gluten free menu is good and offers big portions. I got ribs and pulled pork— very delicious!, I started with their gluten free menu and then our server checked ingredients for soy, which I am allergic to. Awesome meal of salmon, mashed potatoes, fresh green beans then finished with a gluten free brownie. Very happy!, Besides celiac, I am allergic to soy, and our server was awesome checking ingredients when I ordered from their gluten-free menu. I wish we were on vacation in the area longer so we could stop there again., Amazing! I walked in and said I have a gluten allergy, the hostess said when you sit, I’ll send over the kitchen manger. The kitchen manager came over and sat at our table and explained the allergy cooking process. He personally took my order and told me I have nothing to worry about. I had gluten free chicken wings that he grilled for me and gluten free fries which were cooked in a dedicated fryer. No cross contamination, great experience!, Best burger in Waikiki! Dedicated fryer for gf fries., Food took forever to come out. The server was very unsure of gf and brought me out the wrong food. Would NOT recommend., Staff was very knowledgeable and assured me that precautions would be taken to prevent cross-contamination. They have GF buns but the fries are in a shared fryer so they’re unsafe. They were very busy but managed to keep my meal safe!, They have a gluten free menu and a dedicated fryer. The staff and management were very helpful and accommodating. Would definitely come again!, The have an allergen list at the back of the menu. Not sure on cross contamination, however I have coeliac and was fine. I had jacket potato steak and salmon, Staff was attentive to our strict celiac needs. Second time we ate burger and French fries. No issues!!!! Will go back., staff very knowledgeable about gluten free food! There is gluten-free beer, however, it contains barley malt so is not suitable for coeliac’s, Staff friendly, gluten free menu available, Visiting from Sydney with your son who has been diagnosed with coeliac it’s welcome this app is available to narrow down available choices in Waikiki.
Hard Rock Cafe certainly took on on our needs & catered perfectly with wings, burger & fries all designated separate menu.
Thanks to Jack our server & Ann restaurant management for checking through the even., Extensive GF menu w/dessert! Food was good as was the GF hamburger bun. Christian our server was very nice and attentive to my GF needs as was the manager who shared her story of a friend with Celiac. A great place for a confident GF meal., No separate fryer, but my girlfriend was able to have a salad, burger and mashed potatoes with no issues. Plenty of other options on their separate gfree menu. Mention the allergy to the server And shouldn’t have any issues! Great service by Kiya, who had a food allergy unrelated to Celiac., Really good for coeliac as they have separate fryer for chips and gf menu, My coeliac daughter loved her first time at Hard Rock Cafe. The menu was extensive and the food was perfect for a child., Small GF menu..... you need to ask for it.. burgers come with a GF bun...., I was pleased with the knowledge of the server. Had pulled pork on gluten free bun. Was one of the best buns I’ve had. Server reported that fries were gluten free also. Didn’t care for the beans but slaw and apple slices on sandwich were delicious., After reading the reviews I asked to see the manager. He said they offer a GF menu. I asked if he takes celiac disease as seriously as a peanut allergy. He said they take it very seriously. I had a burger on aGF bun , minus the onion ring and steak sauce. After the meal he asked me how everything was. The managers name is Prince Logan. If you want a safe meal - ask to speak with him., Very friendly choice proven this is a fantastic place, The highlight of our visit (other than the dedicated fryer for fries) was when we ordered from the GF menu and the waitress asked if it was an intolerance or celiac. She explained that for celiac, they take extra precautions in the kitchen. The manager brought my son’s celiac meal separately and everyone was happy to answer our questions. The GF buns were some of the best I have had., I was impressed with this restaurant, especially with it being a chain and not having such a great experience at the one in Florida. From the time we walked in and spoke with the hostess to the time we received our bill, everyone was attentive and made sure I was safe and my meal was prepared just right. They even informed me they had a separate fryer for their french fries. Definitely a place to look into when visiting Myrtle Beach., Hard Rock offers gluten free bun and baked fries for customers with Celiac at no additional charge. Waitress wanted to make sure I understood it would take longer to bake the fries than oil fry which is cross contaminated but all food came out quickly and tasted great. I waited until the next day to post this review so I could be accurate on if it made me sick or not, no sickness😊, Eaten here plenty of times and haven’t gotten sick. Yummy burger and fries!, Hard Rock does not disappoint! Separate GF menu includes Kids items and good options overall. Not to mention good food and great, quick service which is perfect for parties with hungry little people., Terrible service & even asking the server who brought out the food to make sure the bun was gf....come to find out it was not., Amazing gluten free menu with lots of choices. They really know what they're doing!, Fantastic service the gluten free burger was excellent . Kitchen staff came to go through the menu, awesome, There was a gluten free menu. We were happy because we went that hungry however they did have a large variety of gluten free options compared to other places we have been to!, Gluten free menu and dedicated fryer. Had the pulled pork (bbq sauce was even GF) and it was great. Felt good afterwards so I believe when they said they are conscientious. Only restaurant where the hostess actually knew about gluten free options. Had eaten at a hard rock hotel 3 years ago in San Antonio and had no luck.. so either things have improved tremendously or this location takes the extra initiative. Would go back!, Waiter was excellent and they have dedicated gluten free menu (available in English). Even have gluten free beer available! Very happy, had no issues eating here, Can I give a negative star? I explained to the waitress that I have an allergy to gluten and very clearly ordered a medium rare burger with no bun. Hamburger came out of the kitchen with a bun. It was sent back where all they did was take the bun off (waitress admitted it). Second burger was made and came out of the kitchen again on a bun. Third burger came out with no bun, but not melted cheese. It was suspected they took the bun and cheese off from burger #2 and threw it back on the grill as it was very well done. Unclear if the fries were safe and made in different oil, but I’m guessing they weren’t as I did not feel well the next day. We were told by one manager that our bill would be taken care of while another manager only took off 15%. It was ridiculous. We will never go back here again., I ordered a burger with fries from the GF Menu. Double checked if they have a dedicated frier. The waitress said they do have one. Nevertheless, it’s a couple hours later and I’m sick. Not sure if it’s from the fries or the burger but won’t be eating there again. Really sad because the atmosphere ist great. The service in the other hand wasn’t., They do have a gluten free menu and gluten free buns but do not have a GF fryer so fries are out and wings which are on the GF menu are cooked with onion rings so those are not really GF even though they are on the GF menu. The staff had to “go ask” to answer all of my questions including seeing if she could find the GF menu. I played it safe and got a steak salad., Seperate gluten free menu! Good selection to chose from including desserts!, Gluten free menu
No guarantee of cross contamination stated.
Good food, Unfortunately they got rid of the GF brownie sundae. Now they only gave ice cream and milkshake which still are good choices. But our waitress was so wonderful that she asked the team to put together 3 GF choc chip cookies in a sundae! She also asked if I was GF sensitive or a real allergy. She was fantastic! Such a great place that we frequent very often. Had GF burger with fries cooked in separate fryer. They have a great GF selection. Always a great restaurant to visit at CityWalk. Kudos Hard Rock Team! Love the atmosphere as I can actually share a nice GF dinner with the family. Thanks for keeping a GF menu!, Burger with gf bun and fries were great. Waitress was very knowledgeable., Gluten free menu with several offerings. Waiter was knowledgeable about celiac disease. I got the pulled pork sandwich on a GF bun. I also got GF French fries.","Diane,piste,Kat,Jamie,Vicki,Lexy,martin,Christine,gfMom23,Georgia,Renee,Natalie,Michelle,Michelle,Alexis,Clayton,gflindsey,Jack,Sara,Rachel,jennifer,Alex,Giorgio,M&M,Rhonnie,MattPrell,Juliette,Robyn,Katie,Sandi,Carolyn,Cory,Jill,Joyce,Angela,Lily,foxboxrox,Jennifer,Kim,Vikki,Taylah,Caitlan Hunter,Lucy,Amy,Lisa,Erica,Lauren,Sandy,Gary,Kelley,Kevin",CO,28,4,38,80202

I came looking for a gluten free corned beef sandwich on a rainy day and the sandwich itself was very good, lots of meat, good quality gluten free bread that did not fall apart even with hot filling, and fast service. As others have mentioned you get two gluten free sandwiches due to the bread size. They seemed knowledgeable about cross contamination practices and have signs about gluten free sides (or non gf ones) and the person making my sandwich knew which were gluten free or not as well. I asked for chips with the meal and the only option was a mini sized bag of Lays, which was a bit odd. The restaurant itself was off-putting as there were handwritten paper signs taped to the front door and cashier stand with misspelled words that looked like they’d been there for months, and the tables and booths seemed to have a layer of grease stuck on them.

Very weird!, They made me a great GF pizza after I told them I was celiac, they were careful in handling and cutting it., The gluten free pizza was the best I have had in a long time. Good salads too., I had to have it twice in one day! I can't disagree enough with the ""... "" comparison. They may not be an artisan establishment, the pizza is made fresh and sliding off the crust hot :-) It's unlike other gf crust I've had. Like a thin crust, with a slight chew, I really liked it. The salami was delicious chunks, rather than thin slices. The veggies are sliced nice and thin, not so thin they char though. Can't speak to cross-contamination, I didn't ask at either location. Though I'm fairly sensitive and had no reaction either time., Not Celiac friendly. Son had pizza there and had a reaction., My daughter has celiac. We eat here on a regular basis. Like most kids, she loves pizza. This is by far her favorite GF pizza in town. It only comes in the 10 inch. I think all celiacs should be cautious about any pizza place, but the owner explained to me their system to avoid cross-contamination. She has yet to have an issue after eating here., Great pizza! CC precautions taken, and everyone seemed knowledgeable about celiac. I'm very sensitive, but no reaction was hard., Their GF pizza is yummy, and they deliver!, Very respectable gluten free thin crust pizza., Less than impressed. Guy behind counter was excited to tell us that they had gf options such as their gf crust and whole wheat pasta. Sigh. Basically, this is a Sbarro's with gf crust option. Ok, but not exactly the artisanal pizza joint I had envisioned., Gf pizza is very good. Staff not knowledgable about gluten and what it's in. Confused gluten and cheese.

This is by no means a special place for celiacs. In addition, some gluten-free products contain dairy if that is an issue for you as well. Not worth a special trip., Who doesn’t love Trader Joe’s?!? Try the cauliflower gnocchi!!, Excellent GF selection, tasty products, good prices. I wish Trader Joe's places were everywhere!!, They have tons of gluten-free options, Love Trader Joe’s for gluten free cupcakes and bagels . So delicious ., Trader Joe’s can do a better job of labeling their gluten free food. They have great bread options and cupcakes. And other natural gf food., Not many gluten free items. No breads, no snacks, no desserts. They have pasta and foods that are naturally gluten free. Prices aren’t good great either. Better off at Sprouts or Whole Foods 365, LOVE their bread and bagels! They have great egg fettuccine in the fresh section, and great speciality pumpkin gluten free products, Their GF bagels and breads are amazing. Corn chips are delish!, Love the gf granola, cookies and ciders, They don’t have as big of a selection of food as Whole Foods and New Seasons, so I only shop here occasionally. They do have some good GF food though and it is definitely a good option for gluten free grocery shopping., Friendly staff, really good gf everything bagels, amazing dairy free chocolate ice cream made from coconuts (like the best I’ve ever had in my life). Good gf dairy free coconut yogurt. A lot of organic fruit. I still don’t understand where to get in line but that’s probably just me., They gave me a list of everything that was gluten free from their store. It was very helpful and they were very nice. I would definitely recommend this store and ask for the celiac safe list., One of the better grocery stores with GF options including bread, flour, and snacks. Lacking in options for sauces and desserts., For those who have an allergy to gluten I would not recommend it .There is nothing that is certified gluten free. ELisa, I NEVER have a parking problem at this Trader Joe’s. It’s crowded but I always park away from the front door. I never have to circle the parking lot, and there are parking attendants to assist guests. ... Anyhow, they have a nice selection of high-quality products that are certified gluten-free. I wish there were more crackers. I love their bread selection. The seasonal hamburger buns are unbelievably good! They are spongy and flavorful., Great store for gluten-free! Staff are helpful too., I’ve trusted trader joes brand products more than any others because they consistently list any allergens under the ingredients, as well as any potential for cross-contamination. Management was also very responsive after I explained that their gluten free rice panko could not be placed next to paper sacks of flour and on my shopping trip (and all subsequent) their gluten free baking products were thoroughly wiped clean and reorganized to be together on the top shelf while their flour remained on the bottom shelf., Be careful when buying their gluten-free or vegan products. I always see, May contain traces of wheat, May contain milk, soy, eggs and tree nuts., We found the prepared salads to be our saving grace while on vacation. They made for healthy and easy take and go GF lunches. We found a few items at TJ’s that we don’t have in Illinois which was a treat. One of our favorite was the GF mini cupcakes!, My go to store for GF items. The nicest staff ever! Love me some TJ’s! Parking is tight... but there is more parking behind the storeZ, The gluten free everything bagel is excellent and is the closest to a regular everything bagel that I can find . I will be back for more ., Gluten free bread, cupcakes, bagels, fettuccine, cookies, frozen meals, Oreos, and lots more! I love their selection and they have a purple and yellow tag on selected GF items so you don’t miss it!, My favorite grocery store is out many GF options. And great prices, Anything labeled gluten free must test under 20ppm. Walnuts, almonds and pecans are safe for celiacs-no shared equipment used to process. If you ask, they will call to verify how an item is processed having an answer in 5-10 minutes., I only go there for store brand bagels and sandwich bread. I’ll stock up and freeze what i buy so i can make less trips there. Unfriendly staff, parking is a nightmare and no fresh prepared GF food. It’s great if you’re eating organic, not GF., They have several GF options that are Celiac friendly as well. Their price points for the products are way more reasonable than several other places as well., Gluten free labeled food...made on shared equipment. Got so sick., The Trader Joe's brand of GF bread is amazing. They have so many snacks and GF food items. Must go!, So many gluten free products and they are all good! They make great gf bread, bagels, pizzas, baking mixes, pancakes, cookies, mini cupcakes ! Even great gf egg noodles and brown rice noodles., they have lots of good gluten free options but their gluten free cookies are the best thing i’ve ever had. they taste normal and i can’t stop eating them !!!, I was so excited to get gluten free food from here. I had fresh bagels and bread that were delicious. However I started noticing I had a really bad stomach ache and nausea. I tried to brush it off because I don’t want to always assume it’s from gluten. After further research it turns out not all of their equipment is safe and there’s high probability of cross contamination. Spent a week sick :/., Some GF food options at better prices, They are no longer at this location, Trader Joe’s has brought in a lot of gf options, now including bagels and hamburger buns., Their gluten-free bread is almost better than their wheat bread I used to eat. Their website has a list of everything that's GF. Labeling saying so can be tricky to find.... Edit: Been getting a reaction from the tortilla chips the last 2 times I had them, so steer clear if you're sensitive. Took away a star.... Second Edit: It's disappointing to say, but I've since had a several reactions to a few of their processed foods, not just the chips. Lowered to 1 star., Lots of great gluten free options for everyone., Great selection of GF foods that kids will like too. Have a list of GF items. Many products are not labeled GF but they are., Many gf baked goods. I love the slices loaf of bread in the green bag. Noticed they put out new varieties of Gf bagels the other day. Their chocolate chip cookies are the best. Also my favs Gf pancake mix (pumpkin for holidays), stuffing mix, flour, noodles, chips, breads, bagels, some frozen items like breaded chicken but be careful to look for the Gf approval I’ve found that even if there is no wheat listed I still don’t feel well., Opened in September- like other stores offers fresh produce, GF pasta, desserts, bread, bagels, pancake (frozen and mix) etc., This is by far my favorite grocery store. They have a hand out that lists all gluten free options, and then most applicable items are also labeled GF too. And the staff is so helpful and friendly!, I’ll give them 1 star because you can’t give zero. Corporate ignored 3 email requests for info, only after I blasted them in social media did they respond in writing with corporate garble.
The basis of their business is pre-packaged veggies and fruits, and it’s not unusual to coat them with gluten because of glutens preservative qualities. They would not answer the question even after being asked three times in writing “ are your pre-packaged items coated in gluten”? Stay away at all costs, they have very little that is gluten free anyway., Don’t be fooled by this place ... Very expensive and very few gluten free options, Great GF products!!! Try their GF breads, baking mixes and frozen chicken nuggets and Mac & cheese., Heaven for anyone with celiac, gluten intolerance, or just choosing to avoid gluten! Bit pricey though tbh, I love trader joes! I put off going for awhile because I found it overwhelming at first (usually crowded) but then I took the time to walk through and found a lot of really great gluten free and dairy free items. The gf flatbread is great and the best part is most things are decently priced. I'm addicted now!, So much cleaner and better managed than Safeway, however, their GF options are limited and nothing is labeled.... Safeway is poorly managed and maintained, and not an enjoyable shopping experience in the least, however, if you’re new to the area or just dropping in and looking for a simpler shopping trip accompanied by clearly marked “Gluten Free” labels, Safeway is a smarter choice. ... Because most everything is Trader Joe’s brand, very few items come up on my GF app, “The Gluten Free Scanner” (full version). Sure, you can read labels, but as a severe Celiac I need to know the conditions under which food has been handled or processed to ensure that I don’t get sick. ... I tend to follow the “Certified Gluten Free” labels for anything processed, but as far as I’ve seen, you won’t find anything in TJ’s. ... So far, so good, though! I can eat [most of] the meats here without contamination and tend to eat a more whole food diet, anyhow, with no issues. ... (I say “most of” because I’ve only tried chicken, stew meat, and shredded meat from TJ’s, but as a former Floridian who was constantly contaminated by Publix’s meat department, it’s so nice to not get sick from the food you cook at home...)... I hope this can help your shopping experience!... Best Wishes,
Sara, My son was recently diagnosed with Celiac disease, and Trader Joe’s has been a life saver! There are so many gluten-free products available, and they are easy to find with just a little effort. There is a great list of GF products on the website, and if you aren’t quite sure whether something is GF or not, the staff will call and check. The GF bread is delightful - truly the only bread I’ve found so far that isn’t horrible. Just wish there was a store closer to Durham!, Great selection, helpful and friendly staff, I shop here all of the time.Read the labels for allergens, but a great selection for individual meals. This is one of my favs.","Vanessa,Dana Delaney ,Brendan,sararosepgh,Emilie,Ryan Morales,Kelly D.,Ness,merriless,Nicole,Stacy,Jill ,Shawna Oakes,<33,Anna,Melissa,Eliza,Renee Matthewa,Wendy,Kelly,Neicee,desirun,Misha,Cathy,Alexis,Mariellen,Lynn,Laine,Justine,glutenfreejaimee,Lisa,Edie,Ireland,Nicole,Ambor,User,Kerry,Darren,Nina,Lorelie,Carrie,User,Kate,Howard,murse,GF on the go,gflindsey,Bethany,Sara,Nicole,Andy,Elaine",CO,33,5,32,80206

Server asked if she needed to alert the kitchen about cross contamination which was nice., They seem out of practice at Gf due to covid distractions. Waitresses know some, but they have multiple people filling a simple order, and so what was supposed to be a bag of chips came out in a bowl. While all my attention was on the bun, manager ran out to take the chips. They’d been refried in dirty oil. I asked to see their gf buns. Sealed in plastic. Texture and flavor will make you think there has been an error. Really good burger and bun.... Buns unbelievable. Burger meat wonderful. If you order medium it is pink throughout. Rarer than most places, but great.... I didn’t see Red Bridge., Create a salad or a burger! The waitress was pretty knowledgeable about what contained gluten or not. On the sauce she wasn’t sure about, she went and asked. The chili cheese burger was amazing! I asked several times to verify the bun was gf because it was so good. The sides cannot be made gf because they don’t have separate fryers. I was served a bag of gf chips though!, Gluten friendly menu; great burgers; delicious pimento cheese that’s gluten free, Be careful. I don’t know how they did it, but 30 minuets after eating a half of a GF burger and fruit I found myself horribly glutened for the second time., My daughter and myself have Celiac, and we’ve eaten here several times with no reactions!, They have a GF menu which includes 2 appetizers and then the GF options from the build your own burger and build your own salad menus. This includes a GF bun, a lettuce wrap, and no bun. ... I wasn’t totally confident they knew what they were doing but it was a good burger and I didn’t get sick. It is a bit expensive by the time you add extra for the gf bun and ‘premium’ sides but not unreasonable., Great gluten free burger place any burger can be made gluten free, not many gluten free appetizers or desserts., Servers confirmed this place is not Celiac safe, The service was as excellent! They have a HF beer and amazing GF buns. I would highly recommend it., Gluten free menu, gluten free buns and gluten free chips. Lots of options to build your own burger or salad. Great service! Definitely will come again., Ate here on a busy Saturday night & did not get sick! I’m not a huge fan of burgers, but these were delicious I can’t wait to go back. My non-GF group really liked the burgers too. As other reviewers say the chips are safe but fries are not. Waitress was super helpful, Gf hamburgers on Pure Knead Buns. No dedicated fryer, but they have gf chips in a bag., Great atmosphere! I had a very celiac friendly experience! Would definitely recommend this place!, Staff very friendly, well informed about gluten allergy and they make every effort to accommodate. No dedicated fryer so avoid fries if you are worried about cross contamination. Great choice if you are in downtown Raleigh., I had a burger with gf bun and fruit. Hour later was very sick. Not celiac friendly., I was going to lunch with a large group of coworkers and I’m recently diagnosed so asking a bunch of questions and making a fuss in front of my peers is still embarrassing for me. I called twice to ask questions (spoke to the bartender Mike who was wonderful). They have extremely good practices against cross contamination, extremely knowledgable on the disease. When the waiter came to take my order, he told me he already knew it was for an “allergy”. So not only was the staff amazing, but the food was DELICIOUS! Best GF bun I’ve had and the chips & pimento cheese are AMAZING! Felt very safe and included eating there., Unfortunately this restaurant gave me the worst reaction I ever had. I also ordered a salad which was even more disappointing when I got sick!, Yum! My burger was so good and the gf bun did not fall apart like other places do. Can't wait to go back again., Gluten-friendly menu and waitstaff claimed to understand celiac, but I requested a lettuce wrap after reading other reviews here (see bun) & my burger came on a bun. Waitstaff explained that it was a GF bun - still not what I ordered. My actual order tasted good - but I am concerned about cross-contamination. Additional notes - our drinks were spilled on the table by waitstaff and we weren't given silverware., This was a disappointment. The server encouraged us to order fries even though it’s not a dedicated fryer. I had to dig and question what else was cooked in the fryer. They forgot the fruit as the side and left off our starter. When we inquired about the starter, they replaced it with a non-GF item. Maybe it was an off day for them. It was just an extremely frustrating experience., Very good, I went without a bun since I find them to be too heavy, and built my own burger. I had gf chips and on tap cider. Delish! Then got a to go order for my non GF husband as he flew in that evening. He also enjoyed his burger. I would feel safe eating there again., DeVonte is the best waiter. I ordered the Sam I Am burger with a gf bun. I asked for them to change the gloves when they placed my burger.
Make sure to ask for DeVonte, Great burger joint! Gluten free menu. Gf buns. Very knowledgeable staff. Amazing burgers. Highly recommended!, Definitely helpful but given the extensive menu the gluten free options were EXTREMELY limited and I ended up with the most boring and expensive burger I ever had. Despite ordering clearly it was the last thing I ate before becoming super sick too. Idk if it was from there but I definitely reacted., Great food! Attentive staff. Dedicated dryer for the chips but not the fries. Gluten free bun was delicious and held together for my burger. I would definitely go back again!, They have good GF hamburger buns. My 4 yr old thinks she got glutened there though. Hard to know for sure. They said they wiped the pan down and didn't use the seasoning., My celiac child got sick after eating here last night. Had a supposed GF burger abd fruit but must have had cross contamination. Have rated here before without any issue but not last night, Double check your order. I ordered a burger and a side salad. Salad came with croutons. I sent the salad back. Just check to make sure you don't get something with gluten. The wait staff did know that my request was serious and took off the charge for the salad. But it wasn't a seamless experience., IF YOU ARE CELIAC, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU. If you’re just trying to limit gluten in your diet because you have a little sensitivity, perhaps it’s OK. My daughter is 14, she was just diagnosed with Celiac, her endoscopy to confirm is Tuesday. Their menu states that none of their kitchen staff or wait staff have been trained on Celiac. It is apparent that they know nothing about cross-contamination. My daughter has only been off of gluten for five days, but by the time we got into our car, she had a severe stomach ache. It’s OK for us, her endoscopy isn’t until Tuesday, but if you’ve already been diagnosed, had your endoscopy, go elsewhere if you are Celiac. I prefer it to Red Robin, right down the street, because they offer grass fed burgers, I don’t like the ethics of factory farming, and healthwise, I don’t like ingesting the stress hormones from factory farmed beef, but unfortunately, we won’t be back., Staff was knowledgable, gluten free bun was fantastic. I stop here every time I’m in town, Celiac and loving it here. Their GF buns are wonderful. The staff is pretty knowledgeable on allergens. Their tator tors are also GF and the best I have ever had!, Has a gluten sensitive menu. The burgers are DELICIOUS!!! I haven't had a reaction here yet., Delicious gluten free bun! Best gf burger in town, My family loves this place. The burgers are truly fabulous and the gf bun actually has the taste and texture of a regular bun. The first time I went in I got takeout (we have eaten in the restaurant since) - and I explained I am a celiac and they went through the menu with me to help me order. They do not have a dedicated fryer and will quickly warn you to substitute the fries with either potato chips or fruit, however they do have a separate frying pan to cook gluten free burgers in to avoid cross contamination. I have never been even remotely glutened here., Eaten her multiple times. The staff is knowledgeable and is helpful choosing items. They are great to let you know cross contaminated items and true GF items. GF buns. My son likes them. I usually get a salad with the burger or chicken on top. Always a great salad and good place to eat., Asked for the GF bun and served me the a non GF bun. Good thing I asked before I ate it. Brought it back out and asked if they remade it; they reassured me they did. ( Felt that was strange since we had to wait 30 minutes for the first burger to come out while the replacement was brought back in about 5 minutes.) I think because I ended up being really sick during the meal I didn't get a new burger...., I have never had any issues here. I usually get the gluten free hamburger., **FRIES ARE NOT GLUTEN FREE**... My lowish star ranking is somewhat of a reflection on the reviews I read here prior to going to this restaurant, rather than the restaurant itself. With such high rankings here, I expected a lot, but what I experienced didn't live up to the rankings on this site.... My burger on a gluten free bun was good, but nothing to write home about. I thought it was a bit pricey for what I got.... I'd read a recent review here that said that the fries were safe, so I trusted that information. We went out of our way to go to this place, just to get there and find out that their fries are in no way gluten free. I like burgers, but burgers without fries aren't much of a treat, and I wouldn't have gone out of my way if I'd known that I couldn't have the fries.... Going on 11 years with having celiac disease, I seek out restaurants that have gluten free fried food, because frying at home is messy and kind of a pain, so having fried food at restaurants is a huge (and rare) treat. So when I was traveling to Charlotte, I wanted to go to places where I could get fried foods.... I did not get sick at Bad Daddy's, and my food was fine, but I found myself wishing we'd gone back to Burton's instead, where I could have gotten gluten free fries., Love their buns! Burger was delicious. Service is friendly and informed! Did not get sick :), Gluten free buns available with your burger!!!, They had a gluten free menu which was awesome and I ordered the gluten free bun. Not gonna lie it tasted like cardboard haha, but I’m still giving them 5 stars for having a lot of options!, The manager brought out the custard mix so that I could check the ingredients. They were very thorough and thoughtful. The food wasn’t bad but it wasn’t great. If you’re in the area it is certainly better than Teds nearby., They have a GF menu and the staff was knowledgeable about both gluten allergies and Celiac Disease. I ordered a cheeseburger with the GF bun and a few toppings and it was delicious! We will be going back again soon., Celiac Daughter: Very helpful staff. They made sure my daughter’s plate stayed without cross contact. We don’t live near her so we asked the staff where they got their buns from, as my daughter really liked them. They not only told us the company but the distributor. They had a huge variety of salad toppings to make your own salad and a gluten-free menu., Love this place. They have their own GF menu with a nice variety the buns are yummy for being GF. Love the music they play in here as well., We’ve been road tripping and it was hard to find celiac friendly things. I was super hungry after living on luna bars for two days. We ordered two burgers ($30). I asked for medium well and said I didn’t want any pink. Both burgers were not even cooked enough to eat. But I was starving so I took the patty, which fell into three pieces and microwaved it. The bun was not good either. It was slimy. Not on the inside from the raw meet, but the outside. My daughter couldn’t muscle through hers so I had to find something else for her to eat. My stomach hurts, but it could just be the grease., Went right after they opened and haven't been back. Experience was embarrassing and my friends felt bad for choosing this place after my food finally got to the table. Really don't understand why this place is so popular., I had a turkey burger on a GF bun and it was delicious! I also had the sweet potato fries and didn’t get sick. Everything was great and I cannot wait to go back!, Burgers with gluten free bread and specific gluten free menu available, great fries., Good flavor and happy to have a burger. I opted for a lettuce wrap as I can’t stand Udi’s buns, though they offer them for $1 extra. No dedicated fryer so no fries, but you get a bag of boulder canyon chips on the side. Usually I love lettuce wraps but they put so little lettuce on it that it fell apart half way through. Needs better execution to warrant the high prices. They seem to go out of their way to add gluten to some things... for example their deviled eggs are fried which makes them unsafe, when they could’ve simply not fried them.","Gretchen,Scott,Cary Opteris,katie,Sarah,Robin Wright,jdrugan,pls,cristina ,vanessa,Heather,Abi,meech,Paige Pelot,Lollie,Angela,Joie,Emma,Brianna,Brian,Beth G,Anne,gfsteph1171,Shelly,Holly,angie,Tammy,Casi,Amy,Rachel,Debra,Jon,Kimberly Nicole,Dani,Cindy Smithers,Melinda,Christy Lundy,Monika,Melissa,T.K.,Deidra ,Heidi,Ashley,Kaci,Christina,Nikki,Michele,Amber,Kristin,Meredith,Lucie,Melanie",CO,21,7,37,80206

The server let her know that it would be prepared on GF equipment in a GF area of the kitchen. She enjoyed her meal and felt great after. I had the GF crepes as well and they were delicious!... Everything on the menu can be made GF, or GF and dairy free. Lots of options!, I told the first gentleman I had Celiac disease, which the chef heard since I sat at the bar. The waiter ensured me they had just cleaned everything and all utensils were new. The chef repeated his things were cleaned cleaned. He then turned and explained the guy next to him, who was maybe in training, about food allergies and how careful you have to be.
So many delicious options. Adorable location. Kind staff.
There is an up-charge but not outrageous., Best ever. Chef actually came out and asked if anyone had celiac, then cleaned the grill and got new, clean equipment. And food was excellent!, They were awesome about my celiac! They cleaned everything off and have big fluffy crepes. SO good! We went here twice on our vacation and was definitely worth it., Despite one review to the contrary, this place is not Celiac safe. I ordered a GF crepe and notified the server of my condition. she claimed they would scrub the griddles before making them, but I was still glutened. Sometimes my desire to have something be okay overrides my common sense. They pour liquid wheat over those griddles all day long every day; I think there is no way to fully prevent cross contamination. If you are just trying to reduce gluten, this place great... fabulous crepes. If you are celiac, stay away!, Awesome place! Have been here twice now - great crepes, knowledgable staff - and great wine!, This place is the bomb!! Celiac safe., This place is amazing! I was so sad when I cut out gluten and thought I could never eat here again, and was delighted to find that they offer gluten free crepes. I'm not sure about cross contamination, but the waitress was great and asked if they needed to use a clean cooking surface for my crepe., The Larimer location has since been closed, only cherry creek is open. The crepes were delicious. They thoroughly cleaned the equipment and used clean utensils., Crepes & Crepes had an amazing selection of crepes, and their gluten free crepes tasted like they were normal. I definitely recommend Crepes & Crepes to anyone who has a gluten allergy., They should NOT use canned food items ever. Canned spinach is a huge Thumbs down. Also canned fruit should not be used for dessert crepes. It's a shame because there is potential and they need more flavor in their crepes. It is overpriced too, Was in Denver for less than 24 hours. We had dessert here at night, a delicious crepe! Then when we had a hard time finding a place around our hotel that had a quick gfree breakfast, we went back in the morning for another amazing crepe., I told the server that I had a severe allergy and she told me that she would take care of me and let the chefs know. Not even ten mins into my meal and I knew I had been severely gluten. I immediately informed her that they had glutened me and I was going to be sick the rest of the day (couple days) for it, and she apologized but only took a couple dollars off our bill and did not comp anything else after they made me sick! No manager ever came over to speak to me after I asked to speak to someone. They cook all the gluten free food on the same surface as the gluten, but claim to be gluten free! Never going back there, if you have celiac disease avoid this place. Terrible experience!!!, I am so very sad, as I was so excited to find a yummy spot to go when we go to the theater. I am now in between vomiting and lots going out the other way. They assured me that it was gluten free and it most obviously was not. I will not return and would not recommend it to anyone who is celiac., Tons of GF options- any crepe can be made gluten free ($1 up-charge). Cute little place, solid meal for $10-12, dessert for $4-7. Wine and full bar. Liquor choices are a bit limited. Friendly service., Delicious! I've been craving crepes ever since I went to Paris but nowhere I've been had gf options. This place can make any crepe gf and the cauliflower soup was so good! The smoked salmon crepe was great and the strawberry, banana and nutella crepe was yummy too. The crepes are big too, lunch & dessert was almost too much food!","Lindsey,Kelsey,Jason,Chelsea,Doug,kt,Lisa ,Tika,Rachael,Vkarayiannis881,Mason22,Beth,Alex,User,Mary ,User",CO,7,1,10,80206

Pretty good and marked with a tag so it wouldn't get mixed up with anyone else's order. Friendly but slow service., OMG I could actually eat and not get sick ! Gluten and soy free usually limits my options, not here . Got the Ruben ❤ Fantabulous service!, delicious breakfast! gluten free friendly!!!, I went here once and ordered the blueberry pancakes. They tasted amazing and I felt fine. I was told that it is a ""gluten-free friendly"" environment, but that most of their menu was gluten-free by default. And I felt fine afterwards. Fast forward 3 days later, I come here and order the same gluten-free blueberry pancakes. However, this time around I experience some of the worst gluten symptoms I've ever had. Insides on fire for multiple days. Unsure whether the pancakes themselves were not GF (which could have been an ordering mistake), or there was serious cross-contamination. Either way, I would recommend Celiacs avoid this place, since there is likely a high amount of cross-contamination., the food is worth the wait! Never had a problem with cross-contamination. Snooze is a must!, Almost too good to be true GF pancakes! Came here numerous times with 3 celiacs and no one's had an issue. Only time there's no wait seems to be 1-3PM Mon-Thurs (closes at 3PM). The 2-person tables in back are awkwardly close to each other and you'll be put there if you only have 2 and it's busy., The food tasted amazing but I am a celiac and I informed them of this fact and asked for a separate cooking surface for my pancakes and they did not accommodate. I ended up getting violently ill. If you are a celiac like me then I warn you against the shared cooking surface., This trendy spot offers a scrumptious breakfast with plenty of glutenfree options, including pancakes, eggs benedicts and much more., Great food... GF patrons will love it, Great service and very GF knowledgeable. Excellent food with a huge GF selection., Amazing food -- loud, active scene. Expect to wait in line., Wow! Amazing gluten free pancakes with plenty of mix-in options and ask about the flavors of the day!, The pancakes are delish, but they always put dairy on top when I ask them not to and, for one reason or another, my innards usually don't feel great later., So good for breakfast. It gets super crowded on the weekends and you can wait over an hour so beware and go early!, The gluten free pancakes are literally amazing! They have so many options!, Good amount of food for the price! It was easy to order and identify the gluten free options. I got a classic breakfast plate and a blueberry danish GF and they were both tasty! My family ordered regular gluten-full food and were very pleased!... The vibe is great and they do wonderful with to-go orders as well!, Awesome. Great service very knowledgeable staff, They say that most of the food can be made gf, including eggs Benedict, pancakes, and all the regularly gf breakfast options like bacon and eggs., Let your server know that you have Celiac or a “gluten allergy” and they will inform the kitchen. Have eaten here 4 days in a row and no issues!... Most items on the menu are or can be modified to be Gluten Free.... Great service, cute patio!, This place was amazing. Food was great, reasonably priced, and didn’t get sick. Most of the menu is available gluten free. Excellent breakfast foods.... Thank you to the staff for wearing face masks during covid 19 outbreak. Greatly appreciated., I really love this place! The food is good and I felt very comfortable with the wait staff and how they helped me/handled our order. I can’t wait to go back!... Very decent amount of options. Staff very accommodating to making and changes if needed, We have eaten at Snooze over the years with no problems. However, yesterday we got their take out for the first time (due to social distancing) from the Colorado Bld location. Our daughter is celiac. We ordered online, clearly indicating a gluten ""allergy,"" adding in the comments that she is celiac, etc. We ordered three kinds of gluten free pancakes for our family. Two of them had their ""gluten free"" sticks in them, one did not. She only ate the ones with the sticks in them and was sick two hours later. She was clearly glutened. I wish I didn't have to write this review as we have loved Snooze but I don't want any other celiacs to get sick, especially right now.... It tasted delicious but that doesn't matter because it was not safe for celiacs., I ordered the sweet potato bacon mashup and it was amazing! The staff was very knowledgeable about which items could be made gf and also dairy free. I did not get sick., Yummiest breakfast and pancakes ever for a celiac like me!, Almost any “bread item” (toast, pancakes, waffles) can be made gluten free. My wait person asked if my gf request was due to preference or allergy. The pancakes (King Arthur) are served with gluten free market and are the best I’ve ever had. It’s my favorite gf place!, They don’t have a separate gluten free menu but they can prepare almost anything on the menu gluten free. I’m very sensitive of the last three places I ate out I got sick but I didn’t get sick here so I’m super happy to have one restaurant on my list of safe places to eat! I even asked the waitress to note how sensitive I am to gluten and they took extra time to prepare my meal to limit cross contamination. I had the avocado Benedict it was so good!!, The waiter was very attentive to my gluten free needs and my daughter’s dairy free restrictions. The gf options are huge, like most of the menu can be accomodated - French toast, pancakes, eggs Benedict, etc. So many options that I needed help ordering. I ended up getting half orders of OMG French toast and Habernro Eggs Benedict. Amazingly wonderful! It’s my new favorite breakfast spot! If waiting for a seat is an issue, then try to come at times that are earlier or not a weekend. But worth the wait! Definitely wasn’t “living without” here!, Dropped a star for horrifically slow service; food is excellent, though. Went for Sunday brunch. Pineapple upside down pancake was phenomenal and not as sweet as it sounds, hash browns were a nice treat, too. I liked that you can add a single pancake to any order so you’re not faced with a just-pancakes breakfast., We had breakfast here everyday of our trip. There is a huge selection and almost everything can be made gluten free. It was such a relief to find a restaurant that takes Celiac seriously., Most of their menu can be made GF and it’s really good! Their Chile verde eggs benedict comes on a stack of tortillas instead of an English muffin., Love this chain. No matter which location I have visited, they take gluten free very serious and makes sure no issues. This location had friendly staff and very knowledgeable., The menu states that there may be cross contamination in the kitchen, however they have gluten free pancake mix and several other gluten free options, my favorite being the breakfast tacos. I’ve had no problems eating here., My husband and I are regulars here. Only 2 items on the entire menu cannot be made gluten-free. The pancakes are amazing! Never gotten sick here!, This place is absolutely not celiac friendly. They have alot of gf options but every single one of them is cooked on the SAME griddle as the gluten food. I could not eat anything here ( celiac) and my son who has a dairy allergy was also not able to eat here. We sat and watched while the the rest of our party ate. Just another restaurant that doesn't care or understand the needs of people with food allergies., Snooze is fabulous! I enjoyed a delicious omelette. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Felt safe eating here., This is the first pancake in 2 years my daughter liked. Big. Fluffy. Yummy. Great gf options. Highly recommend! We were visiting Dallas and went twice!, Got a great breakfast and didn’t have any issues., Amazing! I’ve never had a cross contamination problem, although “diner” style food is notorious for it. They confirm at the table if it’s an “allergy” or lifestyle. I’ve been here 20+ times. Staff is amazing. Get the “sinful pancake” if you want something ridiculously delicious, but not at all healthy 😂, They have the best gluten free breakfast around! The pancakes and toast are so good! I have eaten here dozens of times and have never gotten sick!, I can’t believe this place exists in Fort Worth. It can be very crowded sometimes, but the food is amazing. I had the two Eggs Benedict plate and split a pancake flight (pineapple, sweet potato, and blueberry). Everything was fresh and tasty, and the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the gf options., So many choices it is hard to decide., We ate breakfast here 3 times in 5 days in San Diego. The options were endless and delicious. My kids were so comfortable with eating there and no reactions. The waitstaff was excellent too., —2019 Review: Worth another Shot—
My friend wanted to try Snooze so I decided it was worth giving them another shot...having Celiac Disease, I was not disappointed this time. For being busy for Sunday brunch, the staff was knowledgeable about gluten free options and ensured me that the kitchen staff goes above-and-beyond to ensure there is no cross-contamination. I had French toast and a chocolate chip pancake. The portions are actually huge so I took leftovers home. It was delicious and I had no issues during this visit to Snooze. ... 
—2018 Review—
Snooze was a disappointment. I was super excited to have brunch as I saw gluten free pancakes and French toast on the menu. My grandfather and I ordered the gluten free pancake of the day. As the waitress is bringing the food to our table, she informs us that the pancake of the day is in fact not gluten free. I’m glad that she caught the mistake before we took a bite as it could have been disastrous. So while the rest of my family ate their pancakes (non-Celiac Disease), my grandfather and I had to wait for new pancakes. We ended up getting blueberry & chocolate-chip. By the time it came out, the rest of my family was done eating though. I wish the waitress knew from the gecko instead of hyping me and my grandfather up and making us wait for a new order. Snooze would greatly benefit by putting labels on their menu instead of relying on the wait staff to tell customers what is and is not gluten free., I eat here often and have never been sick. They seem knowledgeable and accommodating of my celiac., Super yummy! Lots of gluten free options (just ask the waiter). French toast was really tasty! Make sure you put your name in on their app!, Snooze knows how to keep me as safe as possible eating out. It's my go to breakfast/brunch place when traveling. I usually get the snooze classic, with bacon, over easy eggs, and sub out the toast for a gluten free blueberry pancake. I always make sure to ask them to follow allergen protocol and empathize at the beginning and the end of ordering. The pancake comes out marked with an allergen stick in it. I also appreciate that they bring out my order separately from everyone else's, or at the very least, my plate has always been on top. Be prepared for long waits unless you go during the week., The gluten free options are endless! There are only two things on the menu that can not be made gfree. The food was fresh, hot, and delicious. My new favorite breakfast spot., Great friendly staff. Visiting from Texas and quality is always consistent across the board. Definitely recommend this restaurant and also this location. Love how almost anything on menu can be made gluten free and I have never had an issue when coming here., NOT Celiac safe. We didn't make it out of the parking lot before getting sick., They use the term gluten friendly on their menu. There are some GF items I didn’t feel comfortable ordering with celiacs but I’ve had success with their omelettes and hash browns so far. Always crowded on the weekend place with fun retro inspired design., Excellent food, carefully prepared as illustrated by the extra time they took cleaning the kitchen prep area so don’t arrive in a rush, or let them know ahead of time. Numerous choices - they don’t even mark the items on the menu and say everything can be made gluten free, but be prepared for substitutions (GF bread in place of English muffins on the numerous varieties of eggs Benedict). ... Also note the hours: they are strictly a morning place and are close at 2:30pm. ... A very small caveat: their black tea seemed to have a fruit added - unexpected and not our fave, but I’m sure they would have replaced if asked., Stopped in for a quick bite. Ordered two breakfast pot pies unfortunately not offered gluten free, one with fruit and one with hash browns. I was blown away with how amazing the food was. The fruit was so fresh even for it being out of season. Hash browns were great too! Drinks from the bar took longer than our food did. I loved the check being brought with a way to pay at the table, no more giving up our cards to strangers and it made it super fast to pay not having to wait for the card to come back. Would highly recommend this place to anyone. Portions were a great size for breakfast/brunch. ... Was told only 4 items on the menu can’t be made gluten free., Almost everything on the menu is gluten free, and they make sure to let the kitchen know if it’s celiac/an allergy. Also very delicious—love the sweet potato pancakes., When we went to Snooze the waiter was very knowledgeable, I had eggs and gluten free toast, which was very good. I would definitely go there again., Very accommodating of GF/DF needs. Server asked immediately if there were any allergies at the table and gave good suggestions., I’ve been here twice and each time the service and food were excellent. Many options for GF. I’ve had the pancakes and the OMG French toast. It’s a treat to come here., Another great place to eat at while traveling or local to Denver. Hubby & I visited Denver for our Honeymoon and before heading to the Science Museum (awesome experience btw), we decided to grab some breakfast. It was busy and packed out the door but we waited maybe 10-15 mins for a table. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable especially with our allergies. The food was delicious and so light weight on your stomach, Pineapple Pancakes & Spud were the best combos to split. The Drunken Chai was great and the environment was on point. We will def be back!!, Staff knowledgeable. Great options including fun unique gluten free pancakes. Items cons out with gf indicator., Delicious and safe. Service was great, food was great, and I did not get sick. Gets packed on weekends though so watch out if you're short on time, We unfortunately had a bad experience due to a mistake. We had informed our server that my partner has coeliac but they forgot to inform the chef of this. An entirely human error but the damage had been done. My partner had eaten almost 2 gluten containing pancakes by the time the server had informed us of the mistake.... I know this place has great reviews and plenty of people have eaten here fine, we were just unlucky. I would add though on the menu they have a disclaimer that they can't guarantee there won't be any cross contamination., Everything is NOT gluten free, why would someone say that?! I've eaten here a few times without getting sick. They offer gluten free pancakes and toast, they take reasonable precautions and do a good job., Told my server I was gluten-free and he knew what that meant. Ordered the Lox 'n Latke Benny. It was delicious., Excellent knowledge of GF and almost everything can be made GF! My fav thing is the Bravocado Toast! Omg amazing! We will be back! I’m celiac and was totally fine, Hands down best GF breakfast place in Charlotte. Almost the entire menu can be GF, and it’s a huge menu! I had the avocado benedict with hash browns and a chocolate chip pancake.

Everyone’s meat was cold and sushi tasted like plastic. Soup was cold nobody in my party liked it. Would not recommend, I'm very sensitive and felt totally fine eating here. They even have GF California rolls (they use real crab meat, not imitation)., Very knowledgeable about gluten free options and yummy food!, Amazing concept!! Lots of gluten free options clearly marked on the menu. Gluten free soy sauce on each table. Very impressed 👍👍👍👍👍, A great, fast gluten free option. We enjoyed the curry and gluten free teriyaki chicken with rice noodles., Great green curry, I used to love Tokyo Joe's. Whole, healthy food with plenty of veggie and protein options? What's not to like? However, since being diagnosed with Celiac disease, I've been to this location twice. Both times I was clear and polite about being a Celiac, and I love the fact that they even have GF teriyaki available. However, I have been very, very sick within an hour of eating lunch here both times. Maybe I'll try it again one day, but for now, I'm not risking it, I have celiac and another allergy. They didn’t prepare my meal safely. When we tried to resolve the issue, we were given a blank gift card as the refund. When I went to use the gift card, Ronnie wouldn’t redeem it. He said we write these types of things in a book. Then I tried to redeem what he said would be put into the book but he refused to make the situation right. Ronnie should be fired for being unprofessional and displaying poor customer service. I would characterize him as a person who discriminated against folks with food allergies. He would rather not do business with people with food allergies or take responsibility for his staff or his own actions. Avoid this location!!! My secondary allergy is life-threatening anaphylactic and it’s understandable that accidents happen but either reimburse people with a refund or comp their meal at the same value that they spent., Soooo sick after eating here. It’s pretty dirty. Drive to any of the Ftco Locations instead, Absolutely love their gluten free chicken teriyaki bowl! Just tell the staff if you have an allergy and they’ll accommodate and change the cutting boards and gloves., Good food and attention to allergies. Gluten free teriyaki or soy sauce., Food was good but not celiac friendly., I have eaten here 3 times without a reaction. I am a very sensitive person to gluten. The sushi is good enough, but I had a teriyaki bowl last time and it was also good. I didn't think I would eat it all but...I did., Riverside isn’t known for its GF food, but I was pleased to find I had a lot of options here. It’s not the best sushi I’ve ever had, but when I’m traveling I’m pretty much just happy if I don’t get sick. They have poke bowls, bento boxes, and a variety of choices of sauces and proteins. I’d definitely come here again. This place is more of a fast food type of restaurant than a sit-down sushi place., My food did not get me sick, but my brother did get food poisoning from the sushi. I would be careful eating here regarding looking out for things other than gluten., I have eaten at this location several times and never gotten glutened. I always make sure to tell them I have Celiac. The food is delicious, and the staff is super friendly., Celiac here and always have good luck with this location. Menu is clearly marked and staff will take extra precautions if you tell them up front that you are celiac. Great staff who is always friendly and helpful. GF soy sauce is available., Have been very good with allergies., This place seemed pretty good, I age here with no reaction! The staff was very aware of the gluten free options. I felt safer sticking to the rolls rather than trying a whole bowl., Lots of gluten free options, everything is marked on their menu. Sushi staff washed hands and changed gloves before making a gluten free roll. The build your own bowls seem very safe and have very little risk of cross contamination because all of their grilled meats are gluten free and the sauces are kept separate and given to customers in to-go ramekins., First time trying it and it was really good. They have tons of gluten free options. They did ask if it was an allergy so they can make sure to prepare it safely. They even have gluten free soy sauce., Good food and nice people. Not sure if celiac friendly but fun place to go. I’m celiac and I didn’t get sick but I’m nervous to say it’s celiac friendly since there’s always a risk when it’s not dedicated., Delicious food, knowledgeable dude gave me gf info. I had the bahn mi bowl and had no reaction. Definitely recommend, The staff is so careful about gluten free food. On a busy night I ordered a build your own bowl and I added crispy onions which aren’t gluten free. The people cooking noticed right away and were quick to let me know and suggested other things that were gluten free. ... The only downside is it isn’t the fastest place to get take out, but they are careful and it’s definitely worth hanging out for a minute to get your food. Love the atmosphere.... Also most of their sushi is gluten free and almost everything there can be modified to be gluten free., There are a lot of options to choose from. Everything that’s GF is clearly labeled on the menu. Fast, healthy options, careful with cross contamination. We love this place!, I have dined here one time and had a good experience., This is my favorite place to come when I visit Colorado! Their gluten free teriyaki is amazing, and I’ve never once gotten sick. Gluten free is marked on their regular menu!, Loved it! Brought the whole family here to eat (myself and two of my children are celiac) & we were impressed with the selection of gluten-free menu items and sauces! The staff was very friendly and took extra care with our orders to avoid cross-contamination. They changed their gloves and prepared our meals on a safe, separate work station. I was very happy with the food and service, so stoked to finally find another safe gluten-free option :) Amazing job, 5 Stars!, They have everything clearly marked on menu and you can build your own bowl as well. They take care for cross contamination if you ask. Some of the staff had general attitudes so I’m giving a 4 star instead of 5 but the food was good, They have great gf options and do a great job preparing food separately. I eat here all the time and never have a problem!, We went as a special treat. My daughter and I. Have not had trouble in the past. I am not sure if they didnt put allergy on the order or not. But the person who made my sushi didn't change her gloves and plated my daughter non gf sushi on the same plate! They did however give me gf soy sauce. I will not be back!!!!, We eat here routinely and have never had a glutening. It's not a GF restaurant, but if you tell them when you order that you're celiac, they change their gloves and take it very seriously. The food is pretty good, especially for kids and teens. They only have GF teriyaki sauce; I think the other sauces have gluten. But if you're careful about sauce and noodles, pretty much everything else is GF., Best sushi I’ve had in a long time! Very accommodating for someone in from out of town! Highly recommend!!!, Good and fast service with lots of GF options., it's safe but sometimes I think they didn't cook the chicken enough haha, GF clearly marked on the menu, and they'll happily change gloves and prep area. (Anytime you ask for an ingredient to be excluded, they ask ""allergy or preference"".) GF soy sauce available for sushi!, They did a really decent job accommodating me. Food was good, not great. Would return in a pinch., This place is hit or miss. Ive had a decent meal, and my companion really enjoyed his. And another time, all 3 of us were highly disappointed., I used to love Tokyo Joe's, but they have really gone downhill fast. They no longer put the gluten allergy alert on the receipt and they start your order before they finish taking it, with no prior notice to the cooking staff that you need to eat gluten free. I get a dismissive ""yeah, yeah"" from the order taker and he finally notifies the cook. That's all in addition to the fact that their portion sizes have decreased and your vegetables are either mushy or raw, nothing in between. I used to go here once a week or more, but I'm done with this place!, They are great with gf and cc. they will change gloves, and when making sushi will even change prep area so it's not cc. I feel safe eating their sushi, as it's real crab, and they don't marinate the fish in soy sauce for flavor like many sushi places., They are great with gf and cc. they will change gloves, and when making sushi will even change prep area so it's not cc. I feel safe eating their sushi, as it's real crab, and they don't marinate the fish in soy sauce for flavor like many sushi places., They have gf sushi and Japanese, plus teriyaki sauce that you can buy fresh that they jar. ❤ So you can go home and make some for a meal later. Prices are reasonable., Food is great but service is terrible. sushi chef gets mad because they have to change gloves for gf. took 20 minutes to get my food last 2 times we went. and I'm pregnant! we won't go back., They have gluten free teriyaki sauce that is brought in a separate container. They have other gluten free sauces as well. The food is very good and they take steps to avoid cross contamination., Healthy options that my family of four loves. We eat here fairly regularly (a few times a month). It's also decently priced for what I consider to be gourmet fast food., This place is great and serves AMAZING food! I have celiac and have never been sick after eating Tokyo Joe's. Food is light and healthy and LOTS of options!, I have been here three times and each time I told them that I have an allergy and need to be GF. Each time I was sick from cross contamination. I have not had issues with other stores, just this one., Delicious and very helpful staff. Good labeling of what is gf., I absolutely had a wonderful experience here. The manager, Mr. Ali Smith greeted us with a smile and set a tone for a relaxed night out with my husband and grandbaby. Everything was made simple with clear marking by all items for any allergies or food preferences. I was very surprised by the ease I had in ordering. The food was very good and we were checked on to make sure we were happy. when we were finished Mr. Smith came over and chatted and we told him about the app I used to find him since he had said many times that gluten free was their specialty, in my opinion they do a spectacular job and are prepared to make boast. I had a great time great food and found me a new gem of a place 😊 I recommend going to see Mr. Ali and see for yourself, Only Tokyo Joes that ever gets me sick. Three times in a row and this location is off my safe list., Great sauce options that are GF. They even asked it GF was an allergy or just a preference. Yum!!, Gluten Free teriyaki sauce, Quite a few gluten free options. Even asked if I had an allergy if they needed to change cutting boards or knives., They have expanded their gluten free options and only use real crab! This reduces contamination risk so much! As a Celiac with Gluten Ataxia (paralysis) eating out is a rare luxury. I have had great success with this location., Amazing place! I've eaten at this location for over two years and have never gotten glutened! They're very knowledgeable regarding celiac disease and various other health issues. So many options from sushi, sushi bowls (salmon poke is heaven), build your own bowls and various signature bowls! I love the food so much!, Just let them know that you have a gluten allergy and to change their gloves. The sushi I had was great and didn't have any symptoms!","Jake,Stacey,Breanna,Jen,Jennifer,User,Brett,Ray,vanessa,Kalie,Lois,Ryan,Elaina,Amanda,Maggie,Courtney,Morgan,momou18,Mercy,Jillian,Kristin,Rachel,Jayne B,Aly,Carol ,Jill,Kate,goldenstateofmind,User,karelyn,Shelley,Denise,Jacqueline,Brian,Cara K.,AK,Pro Level Eater,Lorinda,Shari,Jessyca,Jessyca,Monica,Abbye,Carin,Jessica P,Cally,Sheri,court,Marcy,Abbey,Becky,Sean Johnston,Georginia,Abbey,Cassidy,Taryn",CO,26,5,38,80203

They also have GF cones., Cool cats are kind in here, but not well versed on the true gluten free options. It was a ""I'm sure you'll be fine with any of them that aren't cake or cookie based"" type place. Not labeled GF and you'll have to stick with the for sure gf basic options. Read reviews after for the gf cones, they did not offer it up and I didn't see any signs of it. Delicious!, A scoop of chocolate and a scoop of peanutbutter on top of a gluten free cone was the perfect summer treat. Very tasty!, Inventive flavors, gluten free cones, and really cool staff. I always ask them to use a clean scooper and they're really nice about it., So so impressed with this place! The first time the girl was so nonchalant when I said I had a gluten allergy (I always say allergy instead of Celiac - more likely they understand). Usually this response makes me nervous but OMG she was good. She went out back, washed and put on gloves, got me a gluten free cone out of a sealed GF labeled container, went out back and got me fresh ice cream from a new tub with a clean scoop. All without me asking. I was floored! And the Ice cream was awesome! I got PB&J flavor. The second time I had to ask for the scooper to get me ice cream from out back but he had no problem with it and got me what I wanted in a gf cone and the flavor was even better!!! Salted Butterscotch flavor this time - might be my new favorite! This is place is above and beyond and really gives me hope! Unique flavors and amazing service!, I love this place so much. I feel so less cool once I walk in the place is so full of hipsters. But the ice cream is sooooo incredible., They have gluten free cones (which they don't advertise). Every flavor without the name of a baked good (and some that do) is gluten free, and they have lots of vegan ice creams as well. They have normal flavors, but also interesting ones like salted butterscotch, and seasonal flavors like curry, roasted corn, five spice, dragonfruit, etc. Don't miss their GF peanut butter and jelly when it's on stock!","GF Shannon,Lily,Moon,Alexa,Laura,Gayle,Pete,Rose",CO,1,0,6,80203

Would not longer recommend., Delicious food and great service. They take extra care to make sure the GF options are safe to eat as well as delicious. I ordered the Brussels sprouts as an appetizer that my husband and I split. It was delicious! But my entree was outstanding: GF fettuccine with shrimp in a garlic cream sauce. My husband who does not have celiac tried some of my dish and loved it too. My husband ordered a swordfish dish with risotto that was a special and he said it was the best swordfish dish he’s ever had. Extra kudos for the chef stopping by our table to get feedback on how we liked our meal. I definitely recommend this restaurant!, In theory, this place should be great - has a GF menu, knowledgeable servers, and positive reviews. Ate lunch there for the first time last week, had the chicken salad and GF bread (tasteless and gritty), and got really sick. Still recovering from being glutened. Do not go here if you're celiac., We loved our meal at Panzano, we went for happy hour and sat near the bar with our two kids. Andres was our waiter and was very kind and knowledgeable about gluten-free items And cross contamination. The pizza was delicious. We ordered so many small plates and they all tasted great., Very very pricey. The gluten-free muffin was okay. Overall a very expensive and average place for gluten free., Separate GF menu. Chef and servers were very knowledgeable. Delicious meal!, Celiac and extremely sensitive to Cross contamination. This place was unbelievable. Staff was beyond accommodating, were knowledgeable, and took it seriously. It was the best Italian I’ve EVER eaten and my grandmas parents are from Italy. Butterscotch pudding was also ridiculous. Can’t recommend more. No sickness or symptoms at all., Great food with separate gluten free menu. Staff was helpful and knowledgeable. They have gluten free bread; it is cooked in the same oven as other bread but on a separate surface. Pasta is cooked in separate water., The food is wonderful, and I haven't gotten sick here, but saw a couple of red flags last time I went. First, I had a brussel sprout dish that I've had before. This time, the waiter asked if I wanted it sauteed to prevent cross contamination. I said yes. I've had the same dish before without anyone mentioning the issue. The brussel sprouts were not nearly as food this time. I guess they are usually fried and I got lucky not getting sick last time. Also, they told me they screwed up my plate by putting bread on it and it would be coming later, but then it came really fast. That was suspicious. Have eaten here 3 times without getting sick, but don't think I would try it again., Staff is very knowledgeable about Celiac (not just gluten free). They asked about allergies when I made the reservation, they have separate gluten free menus, and waitstaff was on it. When we ordered Brussels sprouts as an appetizer, they automatically prepared them unfried without my asking to avoid cross-contamination from the fryer. It is expensive and not what I would consider kid-friendly, but definitely somewhere I will go for nice work lunches again in the future. However, I do note another reviewer said they make their own bread and so cross contamination from airborne flower is a concern, so that’s definitely something worth calling and asking about for next time., Homemade gf pizza crust was so much better than most. Knowledgeable staff asked if I was celiac and offered to discuss options. Several options, As someone mentioned, there is a large cross-contamination risk, especially near the bread station and bar. The first time I ate here, I did not get sick; the second time, yes, as it was much busier and they were clearly understaffed. While the staff is generally knowledgeable about celiac disease, the busier it gets, the more corners they cut. Avoid., The staff was fantastic with knowing celiac and offering gluten free bread before entrees! This place is perfect and their pizza crust is delightful! Would go back every day if I could!, Waiter was extremely accommodating, and they have a gluten free menu. They have gluten free bread to pair with their excellent tapenade. When sending my order to the cooks you could hear the waiter yell ""celiac!"", so it was clear they have a plan in place for folks who can't handle gluten, I'm a celiac and did not react. We went for brunch and I had a salad with grilled chicken. Tested the meal and dressing with my nima sensor and it tested safe.
They are very knowledgeable, just make sure to tell them you have celiac disease. Bread is made on site, but in a separate kitchen from where they made my meal. (gf bread and pizza is made in the same kitchen as normal bread though) Waiter advised not to eat the gluten free bread because of how it was stored., Food was amazing but portions are very small considering the price - it felt like eating out in NYC! My husband & I shared the risotto dish & the short ribs. They do bake their own bread but it's in a different area from the main kitchen. I am very sensitive and had no issues., People! They bake their own wheat bread! Flour stays airborne. Huge cross contamination risk! I cannot believe no one else has posted this previously... Sadly, I couldn't stay and eat there. I will say, though that the staff is amazing and honest about cross contamination risks. The food looked wonderful! I wish I could have stayed., I stayed at the Kimpton Monaco, and came here for brunch. They have separate menus for each meal of the day, anything that might be put in a shared fryer is pan fried instead. I had a gluten free muffin (coconut chocolate chip), and the eggs Benedict with polenta. It was all amazing, and I felt very secure with their knowledge of celiac. The muffin was so good, my boyfriend was worried it contained gluten! I wanted to take some home with me, but the were out, so our waitress gave us free homemade gluten free focaccia bread. This restaurant is a must if you're in downtown Denver!, Deliciously romantic and worry free!... HIGHLY knowledge staff will bend over backwards to accommodate any and every allergy. Having Celiac, soy, and corn eating out can be scary. This place makes you feel totally at ease and safe to eat anything including breads and pasta dishes. While on the higher end of the price spectrum it is worth every dollar spent., Margherita pizza was so yummy and it was a great atmosphere and very gluten friendly., I went on restaurant week so my options were limited. I ordered the Caesar salad and asked if they would put some grilled chicken on it for me. They obliged and it was the best Caesar salad have ever had!, this restaurant is amazing, go there if you get the chance! gluten free herb bread on arrival, full gluten free menu, amazing staff and beautiful food!! I really just couldn't fit it all in, this is a genuine gluten free friendly restaurant and I only hope I get the chance to return there one day.... Sincere Thanks, This is why I love this app, finding gems like Panzanos! They have a full gf menu, provide delicious gf bread while you wait for your meal, and the servers are very well informed. the food is great!, Absolutely amazing! I was recently diagnosed with Celiac's and kept reading about horror stories of restaurants not knowing what they're talking about when it came to gluten and cross-contamination. My waiter knew more than I did! He was telling me how a dish was changed so that it as gkuten free, their processes to ensure no cross-contamination, and more. He even asked it my table would like to share a gluten free bread basket instead. I'm glad he mentioned this as old habits might not have made me think twice before grabbing a piece. Wonderful experience, great food (if a bit pricy), and I'd recommend it., I was being cheap and got a delicious arugula salad and a still pretty expensive turkey panini that was alright, but if you're willing to pay, their other dishes looked amazing. Waitstaff was friendly and knowledgeable and I did not get sick., Fantastic breakfast. Get the eggs Benedict on polenta. Can't rave enough about this great place., Hostess and waitress completely on top of it for gf. Extensive gf options. Delicious and healthy...we all felt well afterwards. In the Hotal Monaco. They surprised us with gf bread and tapenade. Dessert options too., Had two great breakfasts here and they were so accommodating! They offer a GF muffin of the day and can make 2/3 of menu items GF. Our first server was amazingly knowledgable and offered to have my potatoes pan fried instead of deep fried to make sure they were safe. A chef brought my meal out to confirm. Second server was enthusiastic but said something about the oil being high enough temperature to ""kill"" the gluten, which I was skeptical of. Had a great GF continental breakfast though and was brought extra muffins at no charge.
Would definitely recommend., Went here with my husband for a special date night. It didn't disappoint!, While traveling in Denver Panzano popped up as GF so we checked it out. They had many GF options, our waiter was aware, it was nice, but... Traveler beware.. It's pretty foofoo- pricey. Ultimately we left because there was nothing on the menu suitable for picky kids, Best GF meal I've had in months. The Eggs Benedict and Prosciutto Pizza is out of this world!, fabulous, fabulous, fabulous! chef is celiac so this place knows what they're doing. went 3 times in one week because it's that good!!!, This was the best meal I had ever had and included bread! No sacrifices for an amazing meal...fried Brussels sprouts, egg plant Parmesan, scallops with risotto and dessert. Just wish I lived in Denver...would make the snow bareable., Yummy! - Dinner was great. Chef Elise does a great job offering items that can be made GF. I tried the Fried Brussel Sprouts and Scallops with Forbidden Rice. I skipped dessert but there were several options.","Laura,Shanna,Judith Bielawski,Demi,Nyrene ,zduck33,Meghan,jillian,Stephanie,Hayden,laxlucy,ceilidh ,Ari,Tanya,Joe Maffei,Emily,michterp,TravelKnitter,Katlyn ,Jason,Lynsey ,candina73,carrie,gftraveler,Gena,Courtney,Joni,trulygf,S&E,Deanne,User,Kristofer,Alison,Sherry Allen,LWags",CO,20,4,29,80202

It is amazing to have a GF beer at the game and they are delicious as well!, NCGI- September 2019—Staff was extremely accommodating with the gluten free options. I got the hot dog, big and juicy and on a GF bun that didn’t fall apart that bad. I do not think they sold any gluten items in that stand, only gluten free. They had 100% Gluten free beer, blonde ale and IPA from Holidaily Brewing Company who are a 100% dedicated gluten free brewery., This stadium has tons of gluten-free options at the gluten-free stand it’s amazing :), Burger meat was full of gristle. Pretty sure I have mad cow disease now. Gross., July of 2019 it’s near section 139. It’s a cart and they have chicken sandwiches, burgers and hot dogs. They also have chips, pickles and brownies. It’s not phenomenal but you can eat at a baseball game- so that’s phenomenal. It’s not overpriced either., Awesome to have a celiac safe place at the ballpark. Thank you!!’, The best thing I can say about the gf offerings at Coors Field is the bottled water tastes like bottled water., Was able to get a classic hot dog at a baseball game! What a treat! 4 stars because the bun fell apart and it was quite a mess to eat. Would still purchase again., So amazing to be able to eat!! Udis isn’t my fave but they have hot dogs, burgers, chicken sandwiches & veggie quesadillas, angry orchard and gf beer, chips, and cookies. So nice to feel normal at a game and not have to even mention allergies!, it's Aramark so it's ungodly expensive. The bread is not very good. I think it got worse this year, 2018. It must be Udi's. Otherwise it's good to be able to get some food in the ballpark that is gluten-free and Celiac friendly. Well that is, other than the fact that they don't police the condiments and other people use them and smear their bread all over the nozzles contaminating them., Visit the gluten free kiosk for delicious gluten free chicken quesadillas! They also have gf hot dogs, burgers and chicken sandwiches! Worth the wait!, My husband & I shared the chicken sandwich and the chicken fajita. The line gets very long and you have to wait while they cook the food after you order. Overall worth it - however the signage isn't great, we walked right past it the first time!, The condiments are even kept separate to prevent cross contamination., Section 143, free standing booth. Hot dog was great!, The hot dog was awesome and my fiancé couldn't stop talking about the cheeseburger. 👍🏼, My son and I love everything here., What a wonderful treat...the hot dog in a GF bun may be one of the best I have ever had (and go to a lot of baseball stadiums). Go early in the game; by the time we walked by around the 4th and 7th innings, there was quite a line waiting at the small cart. The food is definitely worth the wait., I actually look forward to the games simply for these cheeseburgers. They are so good and there are signs next to the condiments saying something like ""for gluten free customers only""... I was recently in Miami and was so sad to see their gross tiny GF selection. I really appreciate Coors Field more than ever now., Pleasantly surprised to get to have a GF hot dog & beer at a Rockies game!, This is the most amazing gluten free vendor!

The best pizza.... Salad, bread and wings, As a Celiac, I have always been leery of pizza joints. As soon as we walked in and asked about gluten free options, the waitress’ eyes lit up and she immediately began explaining their GF methods and food. One oven is dedicated to only GF food, and the kitchen has dedicated prep space. The pizza I ordered, while expensive, was absolutely amazing! I almost teared up - no joke. The restaurant itself is totally chill, and it looks like they have a nice patio out back, although it was closed for the winter. We will definitely be going back when we are in downtown Denver, or will visit their other location down in the Tech Center., My family and I have been coming here for years and it is our favorite pizza place! The staff is super knowledgeable and kind about us being celiac and they have a separate oven to cook the gluten-free pizzas in!!! And on top of that, the pizzas are better than any other pizza (gluten free or not) that I’ve ever had! Very very highly recommended!!, It’s awesome that they have celiac safe pizza, but I honestly was not a fan of how they cooked the dough. It was super greasy and which made the soft dough extremely floppy and wet. Not my type of pizza, to be fair. I guess it depends on how you like your pizzas. The service was really good though!, My husband and I are visiting Denver for the first time so we were a little nervous to try new places due to our allergies. We saw the reviews for Marco’s CFP and had to try it.... THANK GOSH WE DID!!! Seriously the best food we have had in awhile. Amazing GF Pizza and Eggplant Rollatini, seriously the best we have had. We even had to double ask that the crust was GF!! Great environment and relaxing lighting. Staff is amazing and so cautious about our allergies as we have multiple. They even caught a mistake before we got it to our table. Olja and Matt went above and beyond to make everything perfect. Thank you for making our honeymoon that much better., Their pizza tastes fantastic. Not too spendy. They also have vegan options! They have a dedicated space for their GF options that doesn't allow risk for cross contamination and the server was very knowledgeable about celiac and reassuring., Staff is knowledgeable. I’ve eaten here many times and their pizza crust is UNREAL! I never thought I’d have good crust again before I found Marcos!, Incredible crust AND they have vegan cheese, Seriously one of the best places we have ever been for gluten free dining. We could have gone there every day on our trip. Both times we went, we had a delicious Caesar salad and an absolutely amazing pizza. Everything was safe and the staff was completely knowledgeable. Thank you so much for being so accommodating. We can’t wait to go back, This place has THE BEST gluten free pizza, hands down! When the server brought it to our table, I was a little nervous because it looked like real pizza, not the cracker-type crust you usually see. She assured me it was gluten free and celiac safe. Oh my goodness, it was delicious! The best part...24 hours later and I’m not suffering from any cross contamination issues. I highly recommend this place!, This place was amazing. I’m almost embarrassed to admit we ate there the three nights we were in Denver. I have celiac and I had no reaction. The staff is knowledgeable your food is cooked in a completely separate GF wood fired over. The dough is like I remember pizza, chewy. I think it’s made of magic and reheats. My kids and husband got the regular pizza and were also impressed even if the kids wouldn’t eat the crust because it was “burnt” from the wood fire - sigh - kids., Amazing pizza. Dedicated oven, they really understand gluten free. Haven’t had a pizza that was crisp and chewy in 10 years. Worth the money., BEST GF PIZZA EVER! Dedicated GF oven....just amazing....., Wow!! This place was delicious. One of the best GF pizzas I have had in a long time. I had it with a GF IPA... delish!! Must try., Pizza was very good. No issues after eating., Best gluten free pizza I’ve ever had!!! It’s definitely worth the money and they were super careful about cross contamination and other allergens. It was so good we bought an extra one to take home with us., The BEST gluten free pizza crust I have ever had! And a local gluten free beer too. The wait staff was accommodating and friendly. Overall a great experience!, Staff is conscious and knowledgeable. The gluten-free pizza is by far the most AMAZING I’ve ever had! I’m back a second day in a row :) If you’re also dairy-free, they have delicious vegan cheese as well!, Celiac safe and delicious pizza crust! They took extra care to make sure there was no cross-contamination. They have a separate prep area for the toppings on the GF pies and they use a different surface when cooking the pies in the oven for the GF ones. Great service and fantastic food! We all take a chance when eating out with celiac disease but this place surpassed my crazy cross-contamination tests. Everyone's disease affects them differently but I'm fortunate and grateful that the staff took the time to make sure I would be able to safely eat here., Like everyone said, best gluten-free crust., Absolutely the best GF crust I have had. Plus their vegan cheese was great., Had a delicious pizza and vegetable salad here for diner. Staff was knowledgeable about celiac disease. Pizza was made in separate oven. I did not get sick., Excellent GF pizza, probably some of the best that I have ever had in over 10 years of searching!, Amazing gf pizza! The crust tastes like gluten containing pizza and they take great care to label it gluten free. I split a Caesar salad, pizza, and Nutella pizza with my boyfriend, it was all amazing., Unbelievably great GF pizza, best i ever had. They have a dedicated GF oven so are pretty careful. I am celiac and feel like I have died and gone to heaven- finally great pizza for me., After a long search of gluten free pizza this is hands down the best I have found! Pricy but worth it knowing that it's made in a safe oven., OMG sooo freakin' tasty. The crust seemed too good to be true, but it's true! They have a whole separate wood fired oven just for gf pies. Plus the owner chatted us up and gave us free desert. I feel great today, and I am pretty sensitive., The gluten free crust was actually really tasty and I felt like I was eating real pizza! I felt great afterward! Sadly, the only size for a GF option is 10 inches and any toppings (aside from cheese and basil) are $1.50/each, which made this a pretty expensive dinner. I added two toppings to mine and paid nearly $19 or so. Definitely celiac friendly, but not super wallet friendly., Best GF pizza I have ever had., I'm in love with the gluten free pizza!, Tried to order GF pizza, explained the severity of my celiac...still got sick from cross contamination. It was tasty and a fun place though. Too bad., before we were seated, I asked if they had a gluten free menu and the host immediately explained that they don't have a separate menu and what pizzas were gluten free and what ones weren't. I'm not sure if they use a separate oven but so far I'm not sick. and the pizza was really good. it didn't have that after taste I've experienced with a lot of other crusts., They do a good job, Yum! And amazing GF beer!, Best GF pizza I've had, and I've tried a bunch! Pricey, but yum!, This is not the Marco's pizza chain. It is a hundred times better. They make their own gluten free crust everyday and it tastes amazing. One of the best gluten free pizza's I've had. I highly recommend this place if you are in the mood for a great pizza. The staff is amazing as well and is aware of the needs of a gluten free diet., Best GF pizza ever!!!, I had a fantastic GF pizza with pecorino, mushrooms, truffle paste, and prosciutto. Also enjoyed a GF Estrella Daura....my favorite GF beer.

However, yesterday we got their take out for the first time (due to social distancing) from the Colorado Bld location. Our daughter is celiac. We ordered online, clearly indicating a gluten ""allergy,"" adding in the comments that she is celiac, etc. We ordered three kinds of gluten free pancakes for our family. Two of them had their ""gluten free"" sticks in them, one did not. She only ate the ones with the sticks in them and was sick two hours later. She was clearly glutened. I wish I didn't have to write this review as we have loved Snooze but I don't want any other celiacs to get sick, especially right now.... It tasted delicious but that doesn't matter because it was not safe for celiacs., Most of their menu can be made GF and it’s really good! Their Chile verde eggs benedict comes on a stack of tortillas instead of an English muffin., Got a great breakfast and didn’t have any issues., They have the best gluten free breakfast around! The pancakes and toast are so good! I have eaten here dozens of times and have never gotten sick!, Super yummy! Lots of gluten free options (just ask the waiter). French toast was really tasty! Make sure you put your name in on their app!, Another great place to eat at while traveling or local to Denver. Hubby & I visited Denver for our Honeymoon and before heading to the Science Museum (awesome experience btw), we decided to grab some breakfast. It was busy and packed out the door but we waited maybe 10-15 mins for a table. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable especially with our allergies. The food was delicious and so light weight on your stomach, Pineapple Pancakes & Spud were the best combos to split. The Drunken Chai was great and the environment was on point. We will def be back!!, Great breakfast options for gluten free dining, staff was knowledgeable about cross contamination. Restaurant gets very busy so if you download the app you can put your name on the list ahead of time. My daughter is celiac and had gluten free delicious pancakes., Lots of GF options. Server was knowledgeable and kitchen was careful about cross contamination. I am very sensitive and was able to get the french toast & didn’t get sick., Even though they don’t have a separate gluten free menu, the server here could tell me exactly what was naturally gluten free or could be substituted to be gluten free. They have separate cooking areas and will clean off the grill, use different utensils, etc. I got the French Toast Neat, which was wonderful. The hash browns were some of the best I’ve ever had. I did not get sick here., Great variety of options. Very long wait on a Saturday or Sunday, so be prepared. The server was very knowledgeable. We had the lox benedict latkes and it was fantastic., Recommend the breakfast tacos. server nice, food good. Large portions. Good price. No dedicated gluten free prep area but was told everything could be made 'gluten friendly.' Server returned to follow up about my specific sensitivity and made me aware they couldn't guarantee completely gluten free food. No issue following visit., Delicious food, very understanding of gluten free. Locally sourced ingredients, absolutely will come again., GF pancakes are amazeballs!!!!! Hashbrowns are delectable!! Staff is super friendly and helpful!!! A++, The food was good. The line was long. I didn't get sick, so that's good. But they used a lot of language like 'gluten friendly', that made me too nervous to really enjoy my meal, and they didn't have a labeled gluten free menu which makes me nervous., It was amazing. Being gluten free for over 3 years I was used to the disappointment of gluten free pancakes at restaurants. That has all changed. I took one bite and was thinking these were the real deal gluten type pancakes, but they were not. I had my wife try them as well, she thought they were some of the best she has ever had and she isn't a gluten free eater. The staff was excellent and only 1 item on the menu could not be made GF. My wife had a potato hashbrown dish with eggs on top that was equally delicious., They made my son gluten free cream cheese stuffed pumpkin pancakes. Snooze has become his favorite place to grab breakfast., Quinoa breakfast bowl. So good. Knowledgeable staff. Grill was cleaned before the egg on my dish was cooked. Didn’t try the pancakes due to fear from seeing a blog video featuring a positive Nima sensor reading off one of their cakes., This place has a retro feel with great tasty foods and amazing service!, Everything on their menu is available gluten-free and can be made to avoid other allergens. I am allergic to coconut as well as gluten and didn't have any problems. I had the Blueberry Danish pancakes, which tasted lovely and were also really fluffy! The hot chocolate was excellent as well., The salad is safe and tasty. On a side note, there was a giant cockroach on the dining room floor., So yummy and accommodating! I loved OMG! French Toast!, The reviews from 2013 and 2015 about cross contamination really freaked me out, but i've eaten here twice (as well as the one in Fort Collins) and have never had a problem. They wipe down the grill for gluten free, and are knowledgeable about the difference between allergy and celiac. The gluten-free blueberry danish pancakes are some of the best gf pancakes i've had since i was diagnosed with Celiac 8 years ago. Amanda was our server and she was fantastic!, My daughter and
I both have Celiac and are super sensitive.
We were advised both times that no guarantee can be made to avoid cross contamination. We split the Snooze Classic
Three farm fresh cage free eggs cooked any style and your choice of ham, bacon, sausage, chorizo, pulled pork, chicken sausage or soyrizo. Includes hash browns and choice of toast. It comes with gluten free toast. WARNING: shared toaster, so ask them to toast under appliance that melts cheese instead.
We also ordered a GF pancake...it's big and delicious! My husband, who has no issues with gluten, preferred it over the regular oancake😊
My husband ordered the Chilaquiles Benedict
Flavorful barbacoa beef over a stack of ranchero sauced tortillas and melted cheese, with poached cage free eggs, roasted poblano hollandaise, pico de gallo and cotija cheese and the Chile Verde Benny
Slow cooked pulled pork over a stack of green chile sauced tortillas and melted cheese with poached cage free eggs and green chili hollandaise, pico de gallo and cotija cheese. Which are both GF and Yummy!, Love this place. had lots of options, Best pancakes and French toast I have ever had....even before going gf! I had a half order of each so yummy really comfortable and the waitress was super knowledgeable about gf!, Always great, very flexable, sometimes a bit of a wait but totally worth it., Pancakes are made on the same surface as non GF but our waiter was super aware of Celiac and had kitchen staff clean the griddle. Also, get the Green Chili Benedict.. so so good!!, The food was tasty, but there's a reason the website and menu doesn't stress GF options. Wife and son are both Celiac. Server was honest enough to admit that kitchen put gluten (+) pancake on son's plate. Both of them have had severe flares for past 2 days. Don't go if truly sensitive, the cross-contamination is bad., So good. I dream about the pancakes. Always have had a safe experience., I agree, omg. I had the tofu substitute for eggs in the scramble. So good. excellent potatoes. excellent spicy bloody Mary. side of corn tortillas. I usually go for the pancakes but the tofu scramble was calling my name and I'm glad I answered., Their OMG French Toast promoted an OMG from me! Great spot and know gluten free dining., My husband and I flew into Denver on our way to Boulder, CO. We stopped by Snooze Eatery for breakfast and I was highly impressed with all of the amazing and delicious gf options! The wait on a Sunday morning was to be expected so we had spicy Bloody Mary's on their patio while we waited for our table. Great modern environment with upbeat tunes and friendly, informed waitstaff. We split their Bella Bella Benny and OMG French Toast. Both were to die for! I am always skeptical when it comes to finding great gluten free food with foodie twists but this will have me craving Snooze until we get back to Denver. We could use a Snooze in Austin TX., I let the waitress know I was celiac. The chef came our to talk to me, which was comforting. My pancakes were sent out one at a time, another comforting thing. I can't tell if they only cleaned enough grill space for one pancake at a time or if it was so busy they were being super careful about keeping them separate. Either way, delicious and safe for me., Staff is well educated and the food is outstanding, We ate here in mid-October while in Denver on a campus visit. Very popular breakfast restaurant. We loved our food. My daughter has celiac and ate the GF pancakes and did not have any problems. I had the OMG French Toast which is to die for! My husband loved his meal as well., GF be careful!! I got really sick after eating here and I just got eggs, fruit and potatoes all GF according to them!, Awesome breakfast one of the best I have had. Had a classic Benedict and it was amazing! Our wonderful server who is GF too heard my debate between pancakes and Benedict's so she brought a pineapple upside down pancake for us to try! It was also amazing. We went on a sat and I hear to always expect hour long waits for the whole day. But it was worth it. Also wonderful drinks as well!, Snooze is the best gluten free breakfast place in Denver. It's a little pricey but the pancakes are worth every penny. I suggest the Graceland pancakes., Love Love Love Snooze! Eggs Benny are delicious!, Pancakes were amazing., Good amount of food for the price! It was easy to order and identify the gluten free options. I got a classic breakfast plate and a blueberry danish GF and they were both tasty! My family ordered regular gluten-full food and were very pleased!... The vibe is great and they do wonderful with to-go orders as well!, Awesome. Great service very knowledgeable staff, They say that most of the food can be made gf, including eggs Benedict, pancakes, and all the regularly gf breakfast options like bacon and eggs., Let your server know that you have Celiac or a “gluten allergy” and they will inform the kitchen. Have eaten here 4 days in a row and no issues!... Most items on the menu are or can be modified to be Gluten Free.... Great service, cute patio!, This place was amazing. Food was great, reasonably priced, and didn’t get sick. Most of the menu is available gluten free. Excellent breakfast foods.... Thank you to the staff for wearing face masks during covid 19 outbreak. Greatly appreciated., I really love this place! The food is good and I felt very comfortable with the wait staff and how they helped me/handled our order. I can’t wait to go back!... Very decent amount of options. Staff very accommodating to making and changes if needed, I ordered the sweet potato bacon mashup and it was amazing! The staff was very knowledgeable about which items could be made gf and also dairy free. I did not get sick., Yummiest breakfast and pancakes ever for a celiac like me!, Almost any “bread item” (toast, pancakes, waffles) can be made gluten free. My wait person asked if my gf request was due to preference or allergy. The pancakes (King Arthur) are served with gluten free market and are the best I’ve ever had. It’s my favorite gf place!, They don’t have a separate gluten free menu but they can prepare almost anything on the menu gluten free. I’m very sensitive of the last three places I ate out I got sick but I didn’t get sick here so I’m super happy to have one restaurant on my list of safe places to eat! I even asked the waitress to note how sensitive I am to gluten and they took extra time to prepare my meal to limit cross contamination. I had the avocado Benedict it was so good!!, The waiter was very attentive to my gluten free needs and my daughter’s dairy free restrictions. The gf options are huge, like most of the menu can be accomodated - French toast, pancakes, eggs Benedict, etc. So many options that I needed help ordering. I ended up getting half orders of OMG French toast and Habernro Eggs Benedict. Amazingly wonderful! It’s my new favorite breakfast spot! If waiting for a seat is an issue, then try to come at times that are earlier or not a weekend. But worth the wait! Definitely wasn’t “living without” here!, Dropped a star for horrifically slow service; food is excellent, though. Went for Sunday brunch. Pineapple upside down pancake was phenomenal and not as sweet as it sounds, hash browns were a nice treat, too. I liked that you can add a single pancake to any order so you’re not faced with a just-pancakes breakfast., We had breakfast here everyday of our trip. There is a huge selection and almost everything can be made gluten free. It was such a relief to find a restaurant that takes Celiac seriously., Love this chain. No matter which location I have visited, they take gluten free very serious and makes sure no issues. This location had friendly staff and very knowledgeable., The menu states that there may be cross contamination in the kitchen, however they have gluten free pancake mix and several other gluten free options, my favorite being the breakfast tacos. I’ve had no problems eating here., My husband and I are regulars here. Only 2 items on the entire menu cannot be made gluten-free. The pancakes are amazing! Never gotten sick here!, This place is absolutely not celiac friendly. They have alot of gf options but every single one of them is cooked on the SAME griddle as the gluten food. I could not eat anything here ( celiac) and my son who has a dairy allergy was also not able to eat here. We sat and watched while the the rest of our party ate. Just another restaurant that doesn't care or understand the needs of people with food allergies., Snooze is fabulous! I enjoyed a delicious omelette. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Felt safe eating here., This is the first pancake in 2 years my daughter liked. Big. Fluffy. Yummy. Great gf options. Highly recommend! We were visiting Dallas and went twice!, Amazing! I’ve never had a cross contamination problem, although “diner” style food is notorious for it. They confirm at the table if it’s an “allergy” or lifestyle. I’ve been here 20+ times. Staff is amazing. Get the “sinful pancake” if you want something ridiculously delicious, but not at all healthy 😂, I can’t believe this place exists in Fort Worth. It can be very crowded sometimes, but the food is amazing. I had the two Eggs Benedict plate and split a pancake flight (pineapple, sweet potato, and blueberry). Everything was fresh and tasty, and the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the gf options., So many choices it is hard to decide., We ate breakfast here 3 times in 5 days in San Diego. The options were endless and delicious. My kids were so comfortable with eating there and no reactions. The waitstaff was excellent too., —2019 Review: Worth another Shot—
My friend wanted to try Snooze so I decided it was worth giving them another shot...having Celiac Disease, I was not disappointed this time. For being busy for Sunday brunch, the staff was knowledgeable about gluten free options and ensured me that the kitchen staff goes above-and-beyond to ensure there is no cross-contamination. I had French toast and a chocolate chip pancake. The portions are actually huge so I took leftovers home. It was delicious and I had no issues during this visit to Snooze. ... 
—2018 Review—
Snooze was a disappointment. I was super excited to have brunch as I saw gluten free pancakes and French toast on the menu. My grandfather and I ordered the gluten free pancake of the day. As the waitress is bringing the food to our table, she informs us that the pancake of the day is in fact not gluten free. I’m glad that she caught the mistake before we took a bite as it could have been disastrous. So while the rest of my family ate their pancakes (non-Celiac Disease), my grandfather and I had to wait for new pancakes. We ended up getting blueberry & chocolate-chip. By the time it came out, the rest of my family was done eating though. I wish the waitress knew from the gecko instead of hyping me and my grandfather up and making us wait for a new order. Snooze would greatly benefit by putting labels on their menu instead of relying on the wait staff to tell customers what is and is not gluten free., I eat here often and have never been sick. They seem knowledgeable and accommodating of my celiac., Snooze knows how to keep me as safe as possible eating out. It's my go to breakfast/brunch place when traveling. I usually get the snooze classic, with bacon, over easy eggs, and sub out the toast for a gluten free blueberry pancake. I always make sure to ask them to follow allergen protocol and empathize at the beginning and the end of ordering. The pancake comes out marked with an allergen stick in it. I also appreciate that they bring out my order separately from everyone else's, or at the very least, my plate has always been on top. Be prepared for long waits unless you go during the week., The gluten free options are endless! There are only two things on the menu that can not be made gfree. The food was fresh, hot, and delicious. My new favorite breakfast spot., Great friendly staff. Visiting from Texas and quality is always consistent across the board. Definitely recommend this restaurant and also this location. Love how almost anything on menu can be made gluten free and I have never had an issue when coming here., NOT Celiac safe. We didn't make it out of the parking lot before getting sick., They use the term gluten friendly on their menu. There are some GF items I didn’t feel comfortable ordering with celiacs but I’ve had success with their omelettes and hash browns so far. Always crowded on the weekend place with fun retro inspired design., Excellent food, carefully prepared as illustrated by the extra time they took cleaning the kitchen prep area so don’t arrive in a rush, or let them know ahead of time. Numerous choices - they don’t even mark the items on the menu and say everything can be made gluten free, but be prepared for substitutions (GF bread in place of English muffins on the numerous varieties of eggs Benedict). ... Also note the hours: they are strictly a morning place and are close at 2:30pm. ... A very small caveat: their black tea seemed to have a fruit added - unexpected and not our fave, but I’m sure they would have replaced if asked., Stopped in for a quick bite. Ordered two breakfast pot pies unfortunately not offered gluten free, one with fruit and one with hash browns. I was blown away with how amazing the food was. The fruit was so fresh even for it being out of season. Hash browns were great too! Drinks from the bar took longer than our food did. I loved the check being brought with a way to pay at the table, no more giving up our cards to strangers and it made it super fast to pay not having to wait for the card to come back. Would highly recommend this place to anyone. Portions were a great size for breakfast/brunch. ... Was told only 4 items on the menu can’t be made gluten free., Almost everything on the menu is gluten free, and they make sure to let the kitchen know if it’s celiac/an allergy. Also very delicious—love the sweet potato pancakes., When we went to Snooze the waiter was very knowledgeable, I had eggs and gluten free toast, which was very good. I would definitely go there again., Very accommodating of GF/DF needs. Server asked immediately if there were any allergies at the table and gave good suggestions., I’ve been here twice and each time the service and food were excellent. Many options for GF. I’ve had the pancakes and the OMG French toast. It’s a treat to come here., Staff knowledgeable. Great options including fun unique gluten free pancakes. Items cons out with gf indicator., Delicious and safe. Service was great, food was great, and I did not get sick. Gets packed on weekends though so watch out if you're short on time, We unfortunately had a bad experience due to a mistake. We had informed our server that my partner has coeliac but they forgot to inform the chef of this. An entirely human error but the damage had been done. My partner had eaten almost 2 gluten containing pancakes by the time the server had informed us of the mistake.... I know this place has great reviews and plenty of people have eaten here fine, we were just unlucky. I would add though on the menu they have a disclaimer that they can't guarantee there won't be any cross contamination., Everything is NOT gluten free, why would someone say that?! I've eaten here a few times without getting sick. They offer gluten free pancakes and toast, they take reasonable precautions and do a good job., Told my server I was gluten-free and he knew what that meant. Ordered the Lox 'n Latke Benny. It was delicious., Excellent knowledge of GF and almost everything can be made GF! My fav thing is the Bravocado Toast! Omg amazing! We will be back! I’m celiac and was totally fine, Hands down best GF breakfast place in Charlotte. Almost the entire menu can be GF, and it’s a huge menu! I had the avocado benedict with hash browns and a chocolate chip pancake. Amazing!!!, Yummy place! I got the OMG! French Toast. All of their pancakes or French Toast could be made GF. My kids ordered apple juice and chocolate milk with their meals. The apple juice was so yummy, more like cider. My son said it was like eating an apple. The chocolate milk was thick and chocolatey. Only complaint is that portion sizes were on the smaller side and we all left still feeling a little hungry. Kids plates needed another pancake with it. My plate could have used an egg or side of bacon...something. Definitely would come here again., Had the French toast and sausage links. Pretty good and marked with a tag so it wouldn't get mixed up with anyone else's order. Friendly but slow service., I eat here frequently and I’ve never had an issue. The staff is super understanding and can accommodate everything besides the burrito as GF!, Food is not celiac safe. Try the Pancake House instead., We absolutely love this place. The food is great, and we have never gotten sick here from cross contamination., What an amazing place! So many gluten free options. I had the sweet potato pancakes and bacon. So delicious and absolutely no reactions. I would recommend this place to other people with Celiac. Our server was excellent as well and took time to assure me of the kitchen's practice to avoid cross contamination before I even ask him about it. They flagged my meal as Celiac and not just gluten free.","CLMAY,Samantha,Josh,Alaura,Gluten Free with ME,MrsTripleThreat,Nyrene ,Meghan,HannahK,Rachael,gfMar,Alex Dorns,Kim,Kara,Hayden,mcdanim1417,Susan Thomas,Ellie,Noah Pindak,Leanne,alicia Perrillo ,Alexis,Lauren. ,Michele,geffric,j Senap,Anthony,Alison E,AllenW,Luna,Jscott,Joe FX,Jen,Shellie,Zac,HSG,Bethany ,Lew,Matt,User,Lisa ,KinzieM,brad,Cassandra,Ashley Ewing Parrott,Angie,Anna,Nina ,Amy,Denise,Martha ,celiacmomfw,Katherine,Julie,Erica Johnson,Jewell,Ami,Leah,Rachel,Sandy,jillmed,Lolie M,Jordan,Janine,jekel,Peter Myers,Amanda,Caitlin,Rooraff,Jewell,kim,Suzanne Z,Lydia,devluss,Valentine,Nina W,Jenna,Katherine Wood,Katherine,Maximillian,James,Anthony,Tiana,Heather,beccab08,Tricia,ljb in CT,brittany,vanessa,Brittany,Leah",CO,46,6,71,80205

So safe, but not my favorite meal ever., This place is hit or miss for me. I have gotten sick many times but also not gotten sick., A place meant for sharing. gluten free options clearly marked on main menu. Good selection of meats and sides. The smashed potatoes and dirty rice stand above the rest. No dedicated fryer. Darkly lit and loud. Por selection of ciders. Would return., Menu was limited since they do not have a dedicated fryer. Mashed potatoes and dessert were both excellent!, Almost the whole menu is gluten free! More of a place where everyone shares their meal with each other at your table. I ate goat & lamb which is kinda odd but it was very delicious!!! This place is amazing. Also order a coke when you go there. They bring it to you in a glass bottle, The menu is almost entirely gluten free! On Sundays they have gf fried chicken! They do not have a dedicated fryer, however only one item on the menu that has gluten is used in their fryers. I feel safe eating here and have done so several times., The food is amazing. Everything is marked GF. Th u do not have a dedicated area though., This place will tickle your taste buds. Wait staff is very knowledgeable about the menu and allergies. We are gluten, dairy, and nut free. They do not have a dedicated fryer so fried items are not celiac friendly most likely., food was good. im celiac and dairy free.

It was a lunch rush on a weekend but they said that they would clean a part of the grill as best they can. I went really simple with cheeseburger with a gluten free bun. The fryer is not shared. 3 stars for gluten and but 5 star for service and communication., So I have celiac and to be honest it’s kinda sketchy. Just for warning ⚠ needed to clear that up. I’ve eaten here a few times burger only and it’s been tasty AF. The crispy ends of the burger are my favorite. They seem to do the best they can but I can see how cross contamination would be easy. For me out of everything this place is worth the risk 😂 super tasty and fast. I recommend the smoke shack without the sauce and I add the gluten free bun lettuce, onion and pickles. No fries as the fryer is shared., Gluten free buns available. I have celiac and didn’t get sick., Most Shake Shack locations offer gluten free buns for burgers. A lettuce wrap is also an option.... Staff knew about gluten free and asked if it was a preference or allergy. To me that meant they were going to handle my order differently. ... Gluten Free bun was dry, but show me a gluten free bun that's not LOL. ... Fries are cooked in vegetable oil which is a no no for me due to cross contamination with winter wheat usually grown in the same fields as soy beans. ... No problems after eating there., Love the fact that when they didnt knoe / understand they asked. Nondedicated fryer. Fries therefore are NOT GF. Also love that they made sure the line cook knew about the GF allergy., When mention GF bun, staff asks if it is an allergy or a preference.... There isn’t much GF but they do have GF buns for burgers and some shakes are GF. The fries aren’t though so watch out for those., Best gluten free burger buns and very fast for take out! Staff is clean and masked for COVID., The GF bun was excellent and in general they make solid burgers. I don’t know if they have a dedicated fryer for fries, so you may want to check as I’m not celiac., Unlike the previous reviewer, I didn’t mind the GF bun - it was a nice change from the standard, overly-dense Udi’s bun that most GF restaurants offer. That being said, the bigger problem is, by far, the quality of the food. The meat in the burger was soooo unbelievably greasy that my son and I were almost instantly sick to our stomachs after eating it. The patties were thin, extremely salty and, as previously stated, drenched in grease. If you are looking for GF fast food, you may not mind, but I certainly won’t be eating at this chain again. I regretted the decision to eat here almost as soon as I finished my meal., Lots of options for GF and DF. The GF buns are amazing and almost too good to be true.... They cater to many allergies., — All food is gluten free, some drinks may not be gluten-free, Good burger with surprisingly good bun. I don’t think anything else on the menu is GF, but that’s enough to keep me happy. The ordering process is a little unusual in that it is done on tablets at kiosks. You need to make sure that you specify GF bun AND add allergy instructions on your order. I’ve eaten here several times with no ill effects., Gluten free buns available. When ordering burger they asked if it was an allergy or preference. Felt safe having my daughter eat here., This recently opened and it’s a great space. Service has been slow but hopefully will get better as they really get going. GF buns, but can’t have the fries. Milkshakes can be GF depending on the kind but I guess there’s always a risk since they do cookies etc in some kinds. But the burgers are tasty!, No fries. They share oil with other things., Fries are not safe for celiac but this place has a good burger and a GF bun. I have celiac and have eaten here a bunch of times. They are careful, separate my food, and I’ve never gotten sick from it., Gluten free buns and lettuce wraps are available for the burgers. The gf bun was really good!, Only the bun on the burger was gf, not the rest of it. Stay away if you have celiac, The staff that rang me up seemed knowledgeable and the burger was yummy. You can’t eat the fries, though, and their shake sauce has gluten in it. I was a little thrown off that my bun was grilled, as I don’t know if that was safe, and I’m used to being told places avoid the grill because of cross contamination. I felt tired after, but no other intense symptoms. So, I think I got a bit of cross contamination there, but not as bad as I usually react. Maybe inquire more than I did about cc., The staff was very friendly and enacted the gluten free allergy protocol all changing gloves and putting the gf burger separate from the regular burger!! Plus it’s delicious!!, Ordering is done by you on a tablet, so no chance of messing up the order. They have separate entry for gluten and wheat when checking off the allergy list, and when you flag them, a staff would come check your order to make sure that what you ordered are indeed OK with your need. GF buns were delicious and so was the burger great for semi-fast food., The staff is very friendly. When you order the gluten free bun, they ask if you have an allergy to gluten and then make an announcement to the kitchen if you do. The burgers are delicious and the bun is really good! Some of their shakes are also gluten free. They have an allergy menu list with all the allergies and what you should stay away from., Got the gluten free bun and veggie patty which they assured me was gf. Definitely was not and I had the most painful month-long glutening. F shake shack, We went just for ice cream. There weren’t a lot of options for my daughter with Celiac Disease, but the staff was knowledgeable about what she could have and it was prepared separately. The only ice cream option we felt was safe for her was the custard without any mix-ins. It’s good custard though., Got cross contaminated last time but have had one meal that ha no cross contamination, just have to run the risk at this place, The burger and gf bun were great! The fries were questionable and after seeing mixed reviews I did not eat them. Great place for a good burger, Do not know if they have a dedicated fryer for the fries but I did have a burger and the bun was not bad for gf., The burger was delicious. It came on a GF bun. Sadly, can’t have the fries because of the fryer used. The staff was extremely helpful. Excited to return here in the future., Went straight to the counter to ask questions, the girl seemed unsure, but the manager came right over. We went over the options together and my son had a cheeseburger on a GF bun and some soft serve vanilla straight from the machine at the back. The manager actually prepared my son’s food himself to make sure it was done properly, and to put me at ease, and it was on its own tray. A little disappointed they don’t have a dedicated fryer, but not surprised with the breaded chicken items on the menu. Great service, though., My go to guilty pleasure!! They have allergy protocols in place and are always very nice and accommodating, I am a very sensitive celiac and felt instantly sick after the first bite of their gf burger (no sauce). The cross contamination must have been very high. No dedicated deep fryer for French fries either. I will not be back., Love the burgers! 🥰 the bun is amazing 😉, The GF buns are tasty. They told me the GF buns are warmed on the griddle where they do the meat and cheese. The gluten buns warmed in a separate area. I didn’t get sick. The fries share a fryer with gluten so no fries., All you can get that is safe is the hamburger. Fries and shakes are subject to contamination., Delicious, gluten free buns for your cheeseburger! So over lettuce wraps, Shake Shack’s bun is so close to looking and tasting like a normal counter restaurant burger, it’ll have you second guessing if they somehow made a mistake. They do ask if they gf bun is due to an allergy and will make the necessary adjustments when handling to ensure there is no cross contamination. Had my first SS burger at JFK during a long delay and was sooo impressed I frequent the ATX location now. Haven’t had the fries because they are crinkle cut which just remind me of cafeteria fries., GF options for burgers include GF buns and lettuce wraps. Husband is gluten intolerant and it was fine. Daughter has celiac and we did not risk trying the bun. (Curious to hear others’ experiences before we take that plunge!) Burgers came in a paper boat with all buns touching... but we didn’t give specific instructions beforehand. Maybe could have avoided that cross contamination with proper communication, as staff seemed nice and accommodating. Dedicated fryer for their delicious crinkle-cut fries., I’ve ordered the gluten free bun a couple of times and they’ve given me the wrong burger. Be careful here., They have gluten free buns for a dollar extra. Fries are not gf due to shared fryer. Shake and burger were good and I didn’t get sick., Just a note for those with a wheat allergy-the fries are not safe and there is no dedicated fryer. The burger patty and gf bun would be the safest option. The same goes for milkshakes-shared equipment makes it risky for someone with an allergy., My favorite place to get an amazing GF burger AND GF fries. Dedicated GF area. I was even able to get a shake without worrying about cross contamination., If I could rate this 0 stars, I would. Employee seemed annoyed at our questioning of their allergy protocols and kept insisting everything was gluten-free. My daughter ordered a bunless hamburger, fries, and a pumpkin shake. Nima tested the burger and shake and both came back as containing gluten. Terrible experience for this celiac family., There is not a dedicated fryer and the GF buns are cross contaminated with the wheat buns. Not safe for celiacs., Great place . Never gotten sick but I do wish they had fries :D, When I ordered a burger with a GF bun I was asked if it was “allergy or preference,” which I appreciated. My burger came out clearly marked as GF, allergy. Not sure how safe the kitchen is from cross contamination but the guy at the cash did say that when it’s marked as GF allergy they do their best to make sure the worktop is clean. I only had about 10 minutes to grab lunch, otherwise I wouldn’t have risked it, but it turned out ok! The burger was fine, nothing special., Great experience, multiple times! Staff will ask if allergy or preference. You can’t rush perfection, give them about 5 extra minutes to get it together...., Requested gf and dairy free... severe allergy. Didn’t get it., Burger is delicious with the gf bun. Unfortunately, they no longer guarantee a dedicated fryer for fries due to the fried chicken bites., Missed Shake Shack so much, was so pleased to find they offer GF buns! They note and handle allergy requests properly. Fries are not safe but they are up front with that info on the website., Delicious food and custard, dedicated fryer. My celiac wife are safely here., Burgers and gf bun are excellent. Burgers are not large so if hungry get a double burger. Fries are a no go especially if you have celiacs., I love Shake Shack! I'm a fan of classic burgers, and the special sauce they put on their burgers is so yummy. the GF bun is sooo good (definitely make sure to get it toasted - it makes all the difference). The bun tastes like the real thing! I eat the fries too, but they do make you aware of cross contamination for the fries., Enjoyed the fries and a lettuce wrapped burger. They had a gf bun but I just wanted the lettuce. They had a gluten allergy button.","Meaghan,Tim Kline,Rebecca,Chris,Dan,Chelsea,Meredith222,Henry,Mariko Langan,Jessica,missa,Kate,Jill,User,Adam,Charlie,StephD,Thor-Inge,Anya,Gigi,Marina,Sara,Kansas Bowling,Petra,Justine,olivia,Laura,lex0009,Tracy,Alex,JGator,Joana,Amy,Steve,lindsaymancini,Laura,Stephanie,Willie Wight,ash,Holly,Veronica L.,Mamabear,Chris,Kim,Anne,john,Kim,alyson,Ben,Michael,DJK,Lindsey,ImaCeliac",CO,14,7,37,80205

I love Jason’s Deli...only place I have found to get a real sandwich on GF bread. Plus the free ice cream is gluten free 😁, I go up to order, have an idea of what I might want (not certain because GF isn't listed on their big menu on the wall) so I ask the cashier if he knows the GF options. He said ""no, I don't know what's GF. Take this menu (he hands me a small one from behind the counter that DOES list Gluten Sensitive) and go to the back of the line."" The line was all the way back to the front door, so I was not about to wait ANOTHER 15 mins in line. Their protocols for GF do not seem safe anyway. Everything is in one big cluttered line. Think Subway but way bigger and messier. I do not recommend this place if you have Celiac Disease., The staff was great. Even during a busy lunch they went out their way to make sure food was okay for me to eat. Glove changes and all, Great sandwiches that use UDIs bread. I ate here everyday for lunch., Love the gluten free sandwich options. They use a larger size of Udi's bread that is delicious. I work in downtown Denver and this is the best option for a quick sandwich (they offer walk in and call ahead take out orders)., Lots of gluten free options for sandwiches with gluten free bread. The bread is really good., Great staff and good gluten free bread., We enjoyed our meals with GF bread! Great selections- I went with the veggie soup and toasted turkey sandwich with cilantro spread.

The staff is very knowledgable about their gluten free items!, Traveling so was just looking for sustenance, had a baked potato and it didn’t make me sick, just wasn’t great food, I got a gluten free sandwich and the vegetable soup. It was all very tasty, but immediately got glutened. Please beware., We visited this location after reading reviews, and the worker responsible for taking orders was very unsure of how to handle GF food. We ended up leaving and not ordering., Website says this is NOT a gluten free facility., You can get any sandwich made with gf bread. We have been there many times and have never gotten sick.... Everyone was very friendly and helpful, Friendly staff, GF bread available.
I had the BBQ beef brisket potato with cheddar & pico de gallo on the side. Udi’s snickerdoodle cookie (for later) and free ice cream for dessert. Brisket is really good and potato is huge! I’ll be back for sure!, Out of business... Out of business, Potatoes, salads, and even gluten free bread! I had no problems eating here, AMAZING!!! My husband and son have Celiac. They had plenty of delicious options. The portions are big. My hubby is a big eater and he took food home! (That never happens!) We definitely recommend this place., They change their gloves and they make sandwiches on a paper. They have a special area designed to cut only gluten free items., Dine in is great, they take care to keep gluten free orders protected from CC.
Drive through not so great. My food was protected from CC however the bread was not toasted, half of the ingredients missing from the sandwich. A real fail that ended up in the trash and left me hungry. My husbands regular meal was perfect, Very recently diagnosed celiac. Been strictly gluten free for a month. Had salad bar and GS list soup. Tasted great. Unfortunately, this was my first experience being ""gluten'd"". Could be a one time thing, staff seemed a little confused when we started 2cof the orders were GF. Might try again, but I will approach with caution., Always feel safe eating here. Gluten free menu available and extensive. Gluten free bread for sandwiches and even Udi cookies for dessert!
The salad bar has a ton of options for gluten free (ask for a gluten free menu before heading over to it the first time- you’ll be surprised how many of the iffy seeming options are gluten free!)., We eat at Jason’s Deli on Las Cruces and Phoenix. This one was really busy and they handled it like champs. My daughter is allergic to wheat, peanuts and tree nuts. She’s never had a problem., The staff was very helpful and immediately explained where my food would be prepped and which items I could have. Ordered a Reuben with GF bread. Chips are GF. They brought my meal out in a to-go container to keep it safe while moving down the line with a sticker labeling it as GF. Will go back!, Great place to go when you are gluten free. They even have gluten free chicken nuggets & 2 kinds of chips or fruit for the kids. They have a salad bar and lots of gluten free choices on the menu. It’s been a while since I ordered a sandwich from there-when I did they asked if I had a sensitivity and they changed their gloves and gear. Great place!, It's been months since I visited, but I always had good service from people sensitive to the reality of gluten free needs. They were always willing to assist and get get right information., Gluten friendly, allergy aware. Staff is knowledgeable about the menu. If they are unsure, they will find out what the ingredients are. Nice gluten free bread. Good selection of soups that gluten free. Disclaimer sticker on the sandwich when brought to the table. Only disappointing thing., No issues eating here and I am very sensitive. I have ordered several sandwiches and have not been glutened. Always specify for a gluten allergy when ordering. I have had the Ruben, Cali club and cuban sandwich without issues. I don’t trust the salad bar though just from other patrons being very messy with making a salad. They also now have gluten free chicken nuggets on the kids menu, but I have not had them., Got the chicken Mesa salad for my girlfriend since it was listed as gluten sensitive, when I got home I saw that there were croutons on it. Last time I checked those are not gluten free.... Edit: called the store and they remade it free of charge., Were very helpful and knowledgeable when my cousin told them she had celiac. She loved that they had gluten free options prepared separately. Nice to know there are places out there that will take precautionary measures., Ordered a sandwich on gluten free bread to go. They made the sandwich using the heel of the bread. Didn’t say a word and laid it that side down in the box so I didn’t see it when checking the order before I left.

Plus the best tomato soup!!!, Staff was very knowledgeable and assured me that precautions would be taken to prevent cross-contamination. They have GF bread and will make sandwiches with it. Salads are also GF and I get them every time. Ice cream is also GF. They were very busy but managed to keep my meal safe!, The staff didn’t seem very familiar with the term gluten free here . But willing to listen and accommodate . Tuna salad on gluten free bread was fairly good ., Established gluten free menu and even nitrate free ham. New to the gluten free world and this is the first restaurant I’ve been to that actually had a menu they could hand me vs. auctioning off all the items verbally:) I was already a Jason Deli customer before my autoimmune diagnosis but I will be an even more loyal customer after. Thank you Jason’s Deli., Very delicious. Seemed knowledgeable., Thanks Jason’s Deli for the amazing GF bread used for the Paninis. It’s delicious and they understand cross-contamination.

Udi's bread and they have Udi's cookies and bottled sodas with sugar, not HFCS. Highly recommend!, They have a lot of gluten free options!!!! I always get a baked potato and tell them it is for celiac so they prepare it separate in a special container!!! Very nice about it!! They truly try their hardest to not cross contaminate, They change gloves between prep, serve food in a covered container and bring it out separately to make sure it doesn’t touch the other meals. Ask for a gluten free menu, it’s kept in a binder at the register., I have celiacs and eat here probably once a week! Great baked potatoes and sandwiches and salad bar, They identify Gluten Free Options ... I always get the HUGE stuffed baked potatoes. I tell them I have Celiac Disease. They know to change gloves typically. If not, I tell them, “with food allergies you need to put on new gloves” ... I get 2 meals out of my stuffed potato so it makes it very affordable. ... I am extremely sensitive with Cross Contamination. My Celiac Disease was misdiagnosed for 32 years. So, I am running to the restroom within 20 mins if I get any gluten cross contamination. ... As with eating out anywhere, I do not go anywhere near a salad bar because customers always inadvertently cause cross contamination issues. ... I have frequented this location a few times a year since they opened., Fantastic, never had a cross contamination problem. Great gluten free bread!, Jason’s Deli served Udi’s brand GF bread for years, but they have recently switched to a different GF bread. The new bread is terrible- bitter, dry and sandy. I can’t stand to eat the sandwiches anymore., They had one gluten free option, veggie soup. Other than that nothing. This airport is awful for gluten free., Large amount of gluten free options and knowledgable staff & management. Gluten free items are clearly indicated on the menu. Items that can be made gluten free with substitutions are also clearly labeled, which is a trend that I wish more restaurants would pick up on., I love eating here. My favorite is the tomato basil soup. Their sandwiches and salad are great as well. They also have chicken nuggets on the kids menu. Oh! And don't forget the complimentary ice cream! 😀, I was glutened! I’ve eaten here before without a problem, but this time I had a serious contamination. What’s interesting is the lady at the register asked if it was allergy or preference, and told her allergy then asks what that meant to them. She explained they take extra care if the person has an allergy. I thought that was great...till I was sick. Then I realized preparing GF without caution is a bad idea. It means there will be more opportunities for contamination everywhere., Always helpful and you can watch them take care and prepare your food separate. Always good and never gotten sick. Love this place., Jason’s Deli had a great gluten free menu, with tons of options for GF sandwiches, GF salads, GF soups, and GF sides. The staff was very helpful with explaining how they run their kitchen, and while they put a disclaimer that they use a common kitchen and can’t assure no cross-contamination, I witnessed them change gloves and package my sandwich separate from regular sandwiches. So great to dine at such an inclusive establishment!, Excellent food and customer service (Deja)! They made the wrong sandwich but fixed it with no problem., Love their chicken salad and salad bar. Haven’t gotten sick, celiac that doesn’t react to cross contamination usually, Been here a few times and have not gotten sick!

They also have GF snickerdoodles at the counter that are delicious., Large gluten free menu online. Took it serious when I went in during lunch hour - which is normally a great time to disregard gluten being so busy. Food came out in its own container labeled gluten free. Didn’t get sick., This place is so awesome. We ordered the gluten free chicken nuggets for my daughter and they changed their gloves without us asking. I've seen this with Jason's Deli wherever we go. Bonus, they have packaged gf snickerdoodle cookies and ice cream for dessert. Wish we had one near us, Staff was very knowledgeable. Gluten free menu upon request. All I ended up having was a GIANT baked potato but there seemed to be quite a few options. I would definitely go here again just because of how kind and considerate the staff was (they even changed their gloves for my order). Udi’s cookies at the register too!, Great Reuben sandwich. I also had the chef salad. It was also quite good.

Our favorites are the miso cod and salmon new style roll. Absolute best sushi in Colorado!!, Waiter was extremely knowledgable about what contained gluten. Gluten free options on sushi menu are clearly labeled and chef can even make some non-gluten free items gluten free if you ask. Food was outstanding., GF items on the menu are really clearly marked and they offer GF soy sauce/Tamari. There weren't a lot of great GF sushi options, but the two rolls I did try were good and I didn't experience any symptoms after eating!, Great options. Both our waitress and sushi chef were accomodating. They exclaimed everything and how some fish were not added to the rolls because they could have gluten., They even have gluten free soy sauce! This place had some of the most flavorful gluten free sushi I have ever had. I had a fatty tuna roll, cucumber, avocado, and asparagus (amazing! get 2!) rolls, and kani/crab, shrimp, and smoked salmon nigiri, 2 pcs each. A lot right? They had gluten free soy sauce and I was even able to taste one of the signature rolls that they made, just ask your server about the rolls. The smoked salmon was out of this world, and the asparagus too. Each piece had so much flavor. I have had a lot of gluten free sushi and thst is not always the case. We did have to wait a while, but it was worth the wait and the margaritas were delicious. I will definitely be back next time I'm in town., Had a very mixed experience here, to say the least. My waitress was phenomenal about knowing what was gluten free on the menu. However, she didn't quite understand that I am celiac, and so the initial chirashi I received was not completely gluten free. They gave me a new one, but the manager came over and pulled the salmon roe off of it and said he wasn't sure whether it was fully gluten free or not since I'm so sensitive. Because it was Valentine's day, we waited a good hour for food, which wouldn't have been an issue except that they had to go back and fix my order. Just be extremely careful about what you order and double check that everything on your plate is gluten free., Best Sushi in Denver!! Plus they have a great understanding gluten free and a great selection of gluten free menu items! Offer gluten free soy sauce., Sushi is very good. Maybe a bit over-hyped... Staff does understand celiac and what you can and can't have on their menu. They are also able to suggest changes to other things on their menu., Best sushi in town.

One of the only places I can go for some fantastic table breads. Their bread is made from rice and tapioca flour and is amazing.... Awesome salad bar!, There are only two things in the restaurant with gluten: beer marinated chicken, and bread they don’t bring to your table and keep segregated from the veggie/salad bar. You’d think that would be enough, but they also have warm cassava flour and cheese rolls that are simply. AMAZING. The only downside? $$$$$, Almost everything is gluten free the staff is good about letting you know what is gluten free., Totally worth the price! There literally were two things I could NOT have! Two! Celiac heaven! I haven’t eaten at a buffet since being diagnosed 6 years ago., Great food and great service. We walked in right after they opened for the day. Jose, the manager sat us down at a really great table with a beautiful view. He was able to answer all the questions we had about the food and made sure that my wife was taken care of because of her gluten allergy. Being gluten free is not easy but he made sure that her sea bass which was excellent, was definitely gluten free and if she wanted the all you can eat meat, that that was gluten free as well. Joseph behind the bar made one of the best Mojitos ever. Then Noel made really good conversation, super friendly to us, and made sure that the food was excellent.
The service staff was excellent as well.
So if your gluten free, want a lot of beef/lamb/chicken, or just an excellent mojito... this is the place., Have been multiple times with my SO who is a Celiac. The staff was great! They knew which meats he could eat (all but 2) and which other menu items were safe. The market table and bar are mostly gluten free. We were able to find a checklist online with all the allergens listed for each item before we went for the first time. We have been back multiple times since. There have been no issues with cross contamination thus far., Staff was super knowledgeable and there are tons of options here. We have 3 members of our family with celiac, and we all eat here with no issues. One of our favorites!, Excellent choice of gluten free food. Most meats and most of the salad bar was gluten free. Knowledgeable staff all around. Will definitely come back., Fogo is a great option for a group when GF is needed. Clearly the numerous cuts of meat and a large assortment of sides that are GF make it easy to keep everyone happy! The Brazilian Cheese “bread” is GF as it is made with tapioca flour and is addictive! There is an extensive food allergen menu on Fogo’s website and the servers are very in tune with those with celiac. Enjoy!, The waitstaff had no clue what gluten was, nor were they helpful in finding out anything. Wish I had read reviews here first. We were not told the cheese bread was gf or that the chicken was prepared with beer. For a vegetarian, the salad bar is extensive, but it's not an ideal restaurant for a gf vegetarian at all., No GF menu, but they had an allergen list and only 4 items had gluten in them. Even the salad buffet has great options. They bring meat around to the tables and the only thing I couldn't have was the chicken. All the beef, pork, and lamb were GF. Also, the side dishes they bring out were GF as well. Mashed potatoes, fried polenta, and cheesy bread! It was fantastic and I would love to go back!, Excellent! So much GF food to choose from. Gf cheese bread YUM!
Terrific upscale salad & appetizer bar which you can make a meal out of. Highly recommended especially for special occasions., The staff was great about knowing which items were gluten free and let us keep their detailed ingredient menu at our table while we ate. And their cheese balls are gluten free!, The menu is mainly gluten free, even the bread and croutons and meats except a couple chicken options. May be a bit pricy but being able to have bread and a nearly full menu is worth the price and experience., 10/19: ate here again and had a wonderful experience! Highly recommend!... This was our favorite restaurant on our recent trip to DC. We actually ate there twice. It is expensive but worth every penny. Since we are GF and DF there were only 3 meats we could not have: crusted pork loin, chicken legs, and the sausage. There were probably at least 10 other meats we could eat and they were so delicious. They also brought out polenta with no parmesan on it for us. And they walked us through the salad buffet and explained what was safe and what was not safe. You will definitely be stuffed and really enjoy your experience - highly recommend., This was our first time at this excellent restaurant. The food was outstanding - really, really good. Most of the food is naturally gluten free - even the dinner rolls. They provide an allergens list which makes it easy to find the few things to avoid - plus the staff was helpful. It is definitely Celiac friendly.... They have a large buffet, with both salad and other items such as sausage and cheese. At your table, you are frequently visited by a staff member with a skewer of meat - many varieties, one at a time. If you want one, a piece is cut off for your. This continues as long as you sit there - we got thoroughly stuffed. All of the food was excellent. The meat was spicy and very tasty.... We will return!, My 8yr old daughter has celiac and we went here on vacation. The staff was amazing!! Most all food was safe and she loved it!!, The wait staff knew exactly what wasn’t gf, but there are tons of options for Celiacs!, Only 3 dinner items - French bread (kept at a side table separate from the salad bar) and chicken legs & pork sausage (both prepared in a separate area in the kitchen) - contain gluten! It was a great discovery since my family loved this restaurant pre-diagnosis. A number of desserts have gluten, but there’s never room for dessert anyway. If you’re looking for something sweet and still have room, order the caramelized bananas. Knowledge staff, yummy food, no reaction., Staff was very knowledgeable and we had an amazing meal with no reactions. The manager even brought out the allergen list just to make sure I knew of any possible issues. Highly recommend, Excellent food. Was told when I entered the restaurant that only two things on that night’s menu weren’t gluten free. Even the cheese bread was gluten free. Highly recommend, So much food. Delicious gluten free Brazilian bread bites. So many meat options but always clarify if it gluten free or not!!, Everything I tested, the bread almost all of the salad bar, all the meats except the fish, and the creme brulee were safe. The only two thing i was told I could not have were the sausages and chicken legs (marinated in beer) and they will offer them to you i just politely declined. Great meal!!, This restaurant is extremely celiac friendly. Only two things in the whole restaurant have gluten. Even the cheese bread and the Caesar Salad had gluten free croutons., Incredibly expensive, but so worth it. Everyone on staff was knowledgeable. Even the croutons were gluten free. The only thing not GF was the chicken. Everything else was. Didn't get sick. Such delicious food. Come hungry!, This is the first place I’ve eaten at since my celiac diagnosis that I felt 100% safe eating. They handed me a list of allergens as soon as I said I was celiac so I would know what I could and couldn’t eat. The “couldn’t eat” list was TINY. I would definitely recommend this place., Super conscientious staff! They cooked everything separate being very careful with our allergies. Delicious food!, The staff is incredible. There are only a few gluten containing items. The Brazilian cheese bread bites and mashed potatoes really are amazing!, Everything at the buffet bar is GF- even the croutons in the Caesar salad! The only
thing that has gluten is a basket of Italian bread and it is off on a different table. If you ask for the show-stopping sweet and spicy bacon, you can have them bring you a plate from the kitchen so it is not cc with the bread that’s the only thing you have to ask for. The bread basket you get on the table is GF, the polenta is GF. Celiac heaven. Yum., They always know what is safe and what is not (and it's no trouble to ask), and we've never had an issue with cross-contamination. Majority of the food is GF. Great service, delicious food. I'm vegetarian and I don't mind at all when carnivore DH wants to go here - the ""salad"" bar is to die for., Pros: Loved being able to eat with everyone else without having to wait! Lots to eat! All the table platters are GF on a normal basis - Brazi bites are delicious and can be purchased in the freezer section of your grocery store - they are naturally GF and everyone at our table loved them.
Cons: There are two areas of concern. One is the dinner roll section of the salad bar which is separated from the rest of the buffet. Not hard to avoid. Second is a platter of chicken/sausage that roams around alongside the meats. You have to be vigilant to make sure it’s not added to your plate when you’re receiving meat. It felt very stressful to me. Once I figured out what I was looking for it wasn’t so bad. The sausage is spiraled on the skewer so that waiter stands out from the rest. But I would have enjoyed the experience much more if I wasn’t constantly on guard for the beer battered chicken to accidentally land on my plate., We had dinner here recently and noted a gluten allergy on the reservation. Our server was aware of this when we sat down and explained that the only chicken legs were off limits from the meat offerings as they are marinated in beer. Everything else, as well as the salad bar, was safe. ... Were were given some small bread rolls which are naturally gluten free since they are made with cheese and tapioca. The meal also comes with mashed potatoes, polenta fries and fried plantains. I asked if they used a shared fryer and the manager came over to confirm that they do not fry any gluten items in the fryer. ... Food was very good. The lamb options were incredible. Some cuts were a little tough, so start with small tastes and then settle on the best options. Salad bar had a mound of candies bacon which was addictive. I did see what I believe to be croutons near some of the salad options, so keep in mind some things could have some cc. I had no reactions other than being uncomfortably full., The staff was knowledgeable about what was gluten-free. They had a large salad bar. There was bread but it was on a separate area where the rice and beans were. All the rotisserie meats were gluten-free except for the chicken legs and the sausages. I was told the sausages were made offsite and did not have any gluten ingredients but they couldn’t guarantee it so I did not have any just in case. I have not had any ill effects after 14 hours so I don’t think I got cross contaminated! I plan to take my dad here for his birthday in May, Excellent options for gluten free customers, unfortunately the pork, chicken, and lamb options were not gluten free today, but everything else was including the appetizers! Watch out for cross contamination at the salad bar/appetizer bar. The bread at the salad bar is not gluten free. This place was excellent on letting us know what’s gluten free and what’s not. They even brought us a creme brûlée for our anniversary!, 95 percent of the menu is gluten free. What a great experience. We had so many choices and the cheese bread was amazing. Not pricey if you consider how much you can eat here., Manager came out and talked to us about what we can and cannot have. Could eat pretty much everything except for the chicken thighs. Manager told the staff when cutting the meat for us to bring a clean knife to cut with. We could even eat the Cheese bread! One of the places where I feel I don’t need to worry about what I’m eating!, Most meats are gluten free except for some chicken which is marinated in beer. Brazilian cheese bread is delicious and gluten free (made with cassava flour). Some locations have an allergy menu that is very detailed. Mashed potatoes and rice is also gluten free. Almost everything is gluten free. Great experience, but a little pricy, When checked with the hostess, she informed us everything is GF except the baguette bread, and chicken leg marinade. Even the little bread things they serve you as an appetizer if GF. Great place to eat. Come hungry., Ah...... Brazilian cheese bread! Everything was GF except one plate of bread (sep from the cheese bread). Everything was delicious but not quite up to par with the steakhouses in São Paulo (not expecting it to be). We went for brunch and were grateful for some other options., The waiter came by with a list of everything that was NOT gluten free (mashed potatoes, the chicken, Italian bread and several items from the bar). Otherwise everything else is gluten free - just double check!! They bring around gf bread, bananas, and these fry like things. All the meats they bring around are gf with exception to the chicken (tho I saw several times where they brought a skewer of chicken and beef and were touching each other so I just stayed away from that beef option as well)., I specified my gluten allergy to the waitress, she said All the meats except the chicken would be safe for me to eat. Personally I am highly sensitive to cross contamination and even after specifying this, she said all the other meats would be ok, however the Parmesan encrusted pork and the sausages are both prone to cross contamination. I got glutened here, so I would recommend either staying away from these foods or making it very very clear that you can’t have any cross contamination., Eaten here many times and never had a problem. Food is awesome. Highly recommended, especially if you're hungry., The food was amazing! Go hungry because you will be stuffed by the time you leave!, Amazing experience!! Gave us the allergy menu so I could look over every item throughout the whole dinner. The bread was so good and I loved that almost everything there is gluten free! They were very knowledgeable and made sure to explain the ingredients in every item we got., Breads were gluten free and almost all meats. Unfortunately the one chicken option was marinaded in beer. Still an excellent dining experience and they have a binder with all foods labeled for allergies, Staff was helpful in showing me what was not safe. Fried chicken legs and the sausages were the only meats I had to stay away from., Everything was soooo good! The marinated chicken contains gluten as well as the lava cake. The other meats AND the bread on the table are all gluten free!, This place is delicious and super friendly. They brought me an entire stapled packet to show all of the allergens and the waitress went over it with me in detail which was great. Super pumped I can still go here 😍, Very nice and very delicious. Yum, Not only was the food excellent, but they were very aware of celiac and did a great job. By the way first restaurant we have ever been that the bread on the table was already GF., Fogo is a great chain for Celiacs. Make sure to mention your condition to the host(ess) who will ask that the floor manager give you a tour around the salad bar to show you what to avoid. Everything that comes to the table (via the gauchos serving meats and via your waiter) are gluten free except: the chicken, the sausage, and the parmesan crusted pork due to cross contamination potential. So, please do go and eat all of the Brazilian cheese bread you can fit., Carnivore’s delight. Tried this restaurant while visiting Boston. A good place to go when you’re hungry! Majority of the menu is gluten free. The manager came over and spoke with us about our their practices and what was not safe. Staff seemed to have conflicting opinions on the grilled zucchini’s status so we steered clear of it., There’s such a large variety of items here, there’s plenty that’s gluten free, though you have to ask about specific things but the servers will go and double check with the kitchen. The dinner rolls they serve are gluten free, as the Brazilians use tapioca flour and cheese to make puffy little popover type breads. All and all delicious and safe if you are vigilant","gfpinetree,laxlucy,Zac,Jennifer,Frances,Elizabeth Sharer,Brigette,Lisa,Barry,msz,Carli,Christine,Lesley Harris,Jessica,Lisa,John Moore,lollie,debt,LizT,Amber,Leah,Jo D,Sarah,brooke,Tara,Sheena,Jackie,Angela,MShipe,Cristal,Cindy,Joeymac09,Connie,Marissa Grace,Kari,Natalie,Daniel,Donald,vthokiekristen,Tyler,alaina,AJS,John,Natalie,Daniel,Laura,Rhesa Castro,Kristine,Eileen,Jim ,Brett,Suzanne Z,Suzanne",CO,40,1,43,80202

Friendly, clean and delicious, The manager was very friendly and knowledgable. He had a nutrition booklet for me for carb count for my diabetes and told me the best choice of sandwich for the gluten free pita bread. It was amazing. The bread was fresh and moist. It was great., Absolutely do not trust that they will make sure your food is gluten free!, Basically no gf options. Don’t recommend, They have a gf wrap you can get request instead of bread for sandwiches (not listed on menu) and a few other options... love the super sweet chia latte, Gluten friendly wraps. Tasty! Salads as well, They do have GF wraps for sandwiches, but there is a high risk of cross-contamination. I was glutened, and wouldn’t recommend for anyone very sensitive to gluten. The wrap wasn’t bad though, if you don’t need to be cautious of cross-contamination., They had a delicious gluten free wrap for my sandwich. Not sure how careful they are with cross contamination. I was fine though and enjoyed it., Gluten free wraps and lots of breakfast stuffing food that is gf. Nice cheap option in downtown Nashville, There are not many GF options and staff was not willing to help me figure out if there was something I could eat. Poor service as well., American scramble was fine, had no issues. Gluten free wraps were available but I did not try them., Staff told me very high risk of cross contamination. Various bread crumbs are in baskets hanging directly above salad ingredients so fall in. No separate prep space. They are happy to change gloves but they only recommend ordering food for those without a medical condition., I avoid here as I’ve been exposed to cross contamination on things that inexplicably shouldn’t be in contact with glutinous items. I’m not confident the food prep is careful enough, as a result., Staff not knowledgeable or accommodating., They have gluten friendly wraps for their sandwiches. They won't guarantee a gluten free environment, but I've never gotten sick from eating here., They have a nutrition menu but on back easily lists gluten free options. They even have a gluten free wrap!, Only Gluten-free item is substitution of GF bread in sandwiches., They have a gluten free wrap for their sandwiches and it’s pretty good! I only have a gluten intolerance so I’m not sure how Celiacs would do there. But they have a lot of options., Ordered a GF wrap. Had stomach issues all day. Must have gotten cross contamination., Called to confirm and I was told that they don’t have gluten free options, except for salad. My kids don’t eat salad. I wanted an app that would help me find restaurant to eat at that are gluten free- EVERY normal restaurant has a salad on the menu.... so not helpful!, I can’t rate the food because I couldn’t eat it. My husband says the food was “perfectly good for a diner”. They said their GF food was “gluten friendly” because everything is made together, and it’s a bakery. So, safe if you are not sensitive but not celiac or allergy safe. If you are this close I would just go to Mariposa if you are sensitive., Corner Bakery foothills Dr... the worst. No respect for people who order to go. Then when u get ur order of soup, there is no spoon. If you paid for extra rolls, there is no bread. The worst of all is that if u r the only person who ordered 1 item to go . they will take care of every person who comes in who is staying before you will get your order . Although I am only 1, I hope that many"" single order"" people orders will add up to enough to either change the management or close the place down!!!!!, There ""gluten free bread"" is a wrap, it is the worst wrap I have ever tasted in my life. If I were to describe how it tasted I would say that it tasted like turkey wrapped in play-do.. just awful, don't eat here. I paid almost ten dollars to eat play-do, the best part was the pickle they gave me on the side. I'm not a picky person, but they would have to pay me at least two hundred dollars to eat that wrap again!, My twin and I were both told different things about what was gluten free by two different workers who clearly had no idea. Then after specifically ordering gluten free meals both mine and my twin's salads were brought out with rolls on the salads. The whole experience was very uncomfortable and the staff seemed annoyed that we were even asking., Came here for breakfast all week and great for GF. Can have any of the breakfasts with GF flatbread. Staff appeared well educated. Nobody got sick. Will keep coming back., Gf wraps for sandwiches. Excellent!, very few gluten free options., I had chicken salad in a gluten free wrap with chips and a pickle. It was so good that I went back the next day for another., I have gone to other Corner Bakery locations without a problem. I went to this location at the Promenade yesterday and it was a nightmare. I asked the person at the counter if they had a gf menu or allergy list. She said no but they have gf wraps they can make any of the sandwiches with. So I asked which sandwich meats were gf. She said ""the only gf thing we have is the wraps"" so I asked what goes in them and she was confused. Again I asked if they had an allergen list. She pulled out a book and proceeded to read a list of ""gf items."" It sounded weird because she was listing croutons. I asked if I could see it. She was listing every item where there was a check for ""contains gluten"" as the ones that were gluten free. I spoke to the manager and he did not seem much clearer on it. If this was an anaphylactic allergy, they could have killed someome..., Would give zero stars. While they do have an allergy list on their website, I wouldn't recommend if you have celiac. I opted not to eat with my party. Seems the staff doesn't care if you have celiac or an allergy at this location. Eat at your own risk., This should not be on here, unless lemon water is what you want., gabe me 3 different plates none where GF as I asked and all where different, I finally just acceoted one and it was cold, very bad, told the cashier I was allergic and she said ""well I dont know you can just have fruit"", I was a bit confused, so I called. No bakery items are GF. Only sandwich wraps and maybe soup. I skipped this place, Had gluten free bread which I was happy about, but no deserts!:(, No GF baked goods. They offer a ""gluten conscious"" wrap but my daughter worked here and said everything including the salads get contaminated. Don't eat here if you are celiac or v gluten sensitive., No gluten free options that I could see., They have little or no gf foods so don't go here at all, Not GFiendly at all. All they have is a GFree wrap but couldn't tell me ANYTHING else at all was GF. Lousy service. I didn't eat. Went somewhere else., You can order any sandwich on a gluten free wrap., The staff claims no gf options, So, very recently ate here with my kids. Very little in the way of options for me (Celiac with a dairy allergy too). I got the only thing I could which was a flat-bread style sandwich. I ended up having the most meat in my sandwich of the 4 of us. And I'm usually the vegetarian. But that option was practically nil as well. Okay pricing for this area and typical. About $9/person for sandwich and tiny soup. Thin sandwiches for all 3 kids. (we were all hungry about an hour later) Only dairy or gluten soups available, no options without GF/DF. No desserts were GF nor DF. Lack of a substantial sandwich will not bring us there again, although they tasted good, the value wasn't there, honestly., Stopped in yesterday to ask about their gf-ness after seeing them listed here. Server was super knowledgeable, said gf pastries are made on separate equipment, handled with different tongs, etc., They do not have gluten free option any more except for breakfast, Staff have told me that they're not appropriate for celiacs., They will do any sandwich in a gfree wrap instead of bread or bun. The wrap was not very good at all. They don't have a separate prep area. I'm not celiac or extra sensitive so I was fine, but this place is not for celiacs., They used to have GF bread but they stopped carrying it. Now there aren't many options., They have no gluten free desserts., My daughter had scrambled eggs with bacon and GF bread which she thoroughly enjoyed. The person who took our order was Gluten aware. I was a bit nervous about cross contamination, but she experienced no Gluten reactions and she is super sensitive. The only GF bakery option was bread., No gluten free options., the worst spent a few minutes talking to the person at the counter about gf prep. Felt like it might be safe, get my food and found out she didn't even mark it gf. it looked to good to be true and was. stay away might ruin your day","Jessica,wyogirl,ams,iliana,Lora Jackson Legare,Julia,Shawna,Clayton,Katie,rivory,duke tennis,jamie,Kurt L.,Tricia,GF-PJ,Jerianne,Alan,Debra,Jennifer R,Madeline,Angie Smith,rosalind ,Onyx,Leslie Halpern,Shannon,Jacy,benedmonton,DS,nhep,Allison,Kristi,E,Kevin,Laura,Laura,Cottonwoodz,Angelina ,pjcook,Rachel Vinciguerra,Lisa,John,Marcia,Holly,Kay M,Ely,Allison,Joel Wasinger,sdc,Charcars,Arielle,PSB,abbyers ,Thomas",CO,3,19,32,80202

Food is always good and I have yet to get sick after eating there., Our family ate lunch here; my daughters eat GF and PF Chang always does a good job. We get the bowl of egg drop soup; it’s huge and the four of us each had two small cup-sized bowls. One daughter likes the chicken fried rice. The other tried a new dish - shrimp in a lobster sauce; it was okay. I had the ginger chicken as usual. We don’t eat at PF Chang often, and we’re looking forward to the GF chocolate dome dessert — THEY DON’T SERVE IT ANYMORE! It is an issue with the supplier. We were sad. :(, They have delicious celiac friendly menu, and dedicated GF kitchen area! Way to go PF chang’s, Everything here was perfect. It's nice that the place is close to union station (walking distance). I would recommend. All Gf food was good, no one got sick. 3 of the 4 of us had the chocolate dome cake (gf), Consistent, safe., excellent culture towards food allergies from the corporate level on down. as with any large company you can get some misses but the locations I've been to make it right., Great GF choices. Great service., A standby for me. Large selection of GF items and my coworkers don't mind eating their GF options when we order family style., Great gluten free choices, Lots of options! Whole family will eat gluten free when we go because they cannot tell the difference., Mongolian beef is delicious! Great food for the whole GF family and friendly service., They literally do not have any but will pretend they know what you are talking about when you call. The amount of times I try ordering hoping it will just be a little bad is so sad. Every time my food is labeled gluten free it is not. The manager specifically told me how to tell if my food was gluten free or not and everytime it is not and I get HORRIBLY SICK. I wish they would like realize the harm of sending out fake labeled gluten free meals., I ate takeout from this location tonight for dinner and have been feeling bad ever since. I'm already having toilet problems. Definitely got sick from them tonight 😭, It’s hard to find gluten free Chinese and I was really impressed with PF. They labeled everything and the menu was bigger than anywhere else I’ve been. Very happy considering it was Chinese and options are so limited., Ordered takeout tonight. Everything was clearly labeled gluten free and DELICIOUS!, Wonderful and delicious! A wide variety of incredible GF and Celiac safe food. Whether you order Pad Thai, Egg Drop Soup, Chang’s Spicy Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Beef w/ Broccoli, or Fried Rice, you won’t be disappointed!, 8/12/2020 Their web site states that they are permanently closed!... We had Chang'sSpicy Chicken. It was delicious and i had no reaction, I spoke with the manager and he assured me they used a separate space to prepare food, separate pans and utensils however, my meal made me sick... I ordered the chicken lettuce wrap yesterday. I felt terrible afterwards so I think there was gluten in my meal., Ordered several times from their gluten free menu and always received great food that was gluten free. One of the few ""safe"" places for us celiac folks., They have a dedicated GF wok and pans that they use in the kitchen when prepping all GF items.... The food is delicious and the GF portions are comparable, if not, larger than the regular dishes... I love this place! I have celiac and a dairy allergy and eat here often and have NEVER had an issue. Every time I go, I alert my server of my allergies and they print off a menu of items I can eat based on my allergies. The lettuce wraps & Singapore noodles are a must! All GF foods come out on a circular black rimmed plate that says PF Changs so you know its a GF/allergy meal. If you order online your food will have a pink allergy sticker on it, just make sure you write your allergies/state you have celiac in the notes section. I ate here a ton before COVID & have ordered a few times now since COVID and havent gotten sick or had any reaction at all and I am extremely sensitive, like i will get gluten symptoms from just walking down the bread aisle at the store sensitive. To the person that said their food came back with gluten on the Nima Sensor - 1) Did you not state in the allergy box that you had celiac and/or allergy? 2) The Nima Sensor has been known to make errors with asian cuisine 3) Did your food have a pink allergy sticker on it when you ordered? If not, it’s best to call and double check!, Food is delicious, I didn't get sick which is a bonus...just wish it didn't cost so much to eat there., Ordered carry out with the
Co-Vid in place. I stressed on the phone that I have celiac and would need precautions taken.
Partially finished my meal, when I discovered a gluten noodle in my gluten free meal.... I got glutened and sick from eating at this location.
I am finding that P.F. Chang’s company-wide are not consistent with gluten free. I wish they did better., Not good with cross contamination. May have a gluten free menu and supposed kitchen area. But every time we have tried this place my wife got sick., For a while after they first opened, they seemed aware of gluten and I never had reactions. I’m not sure if they just didn’t train their other chefs well, but for the past year or so, reactions have been terrible. I try again every once in a while just in case bc I love the food, but this time I’m finished. It’s just not worth the risk., Online ordering can cause a simple mistake! While ordering on the gluten free menu you can make substitutions that are NOT gluten free 😭 spicy chicken meal allowed to substitute shrimp, Dedicated area and cooking... Egg drop soup, GF fried rice are so good., Fine options, PF Changs is the best place for GF food. They take incredible precautions and the food is very addicting. Spicy Changs Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Chicken Lettuce Wraps, and egg drop soup are my personal favs., The GF chicken Lettuce wraps and fried rice are a go to! My non-GF husband even chooses the GF versions here he says it tastes better. Attentive and knowledgable staff even sent over a manager to make sure it was prepared correctly, They do a good job, Amazing! Ate at this chain successfully twice in Vegas and tried it in Winnipeg and everything was just as good. Lettuce wraps, street noodles and fried rice were delicious and gluten free (I’m very sensitive). Highly recommend A+., Ordered all of these item from designated GF menu: egg drop soup, spicy chicken, beef magnolia, and the famous chicken wraps w/ lettuce. ALL came back as GLUTEN found when tested separate in the Nima sensor. I LOVE PF Changs and so I just really really wanted it to be GF! Which is why I tested all items individually. Of course restuarants cannot ensure 100% GF but, please remember, just because you do not get sick - doesn't make it gluten free. :( bummed about this one., Ordered all of these item from designated GF menu: egg drop soup, spicy chicken, beef magnolia, and the famous chicken wraps w/ lettuce.

Emphasize the gluten allergy to your waiter/waitress and you should be good and have a great night... Honestly all your fav options have a GF alternative. The lettuce Wraps being the best one ever!, The gluten free lettuce wraps are always so good!, My take out food had a bright sticker denoting gluten free... The food was delicious. I did not get sick. It was fresh and pick up was very fast. Curbside pickup was efficient, I ordered 3 gluten free pad thai for lunch costing over $50 for lunch and I got sick. I thought by ordering 3, there would be less chance of eating the wrong one. I would not recommend to any Celiac person., Delicious spicy chicken and fried rice, both gluten free!, Awful! Drove 45 mins there (and back) only to realize the food was ALL wrong (had someone go over food there- to ""ensure"" everything in order was there- that person doesn't know what 'correct' is (their words, not mine). First- ALL of the food was cold (I know it was a 45 min drive back, but every other food places' food stays hot- in insulated cooler). The kids chicken fried rice was an adult's, divided in half (so all the veggies) and the chicken was breaded (mgr says that's how they do all kids food bc kids are picky), yet the 'normal' kids chicken fried rice looked like it always does. (So yes, it's gf, but they add breading mix, but it's under the ppm for gf) WHAT?! All because kids are ""picky"", but apparently not ALL. The manager tried to make sense of what happened, but was getting texts and kept changing up what happened. In the end she gave us a refund (good, because there was NO WAY I'm risking a reaction when clearly they don't know what they're doing). Happy Birthday to my husband 🙄😡 Would not EVER recc this pf changs for GF or otherwise., There is nice variety in the options. The Mongolian beef and spicy chicken are my favorites. I haven’t been able to find any other awesome breaded chicken that satisfies the cravings for Chinese food.... They have delivery options, I’ve had several options off the gluten free menu over the last week and all were so good! Didn’t get sick at all., I just had the chicken pad Thai and it was delicious. I am a severe Celiac. and I feel confident that I will not get sick. The manager Patrick was wonderful! I’ve never been glutoned at either of the 2 of Chang’s that I frequent., I ordered all Gluten free for my wife on Mother’s Day and unfortunately with Celiac she got so sick. It’s now 1 week later and she still feels sick. I reached out to the Fresno store and got no response from them. Very disappointed. We go to the Monterey store on a monthly basis and my wife has had no issues at all. Fresno sucks. This is the second bad experience with this store. Never again.... Not bad., I’ve never had a problem here! A moderately sized GF menu and GF food comes out with a special plate if dining in and with a big orange sticker if taking out. They’re also doing take-out during COVID-19, so it’s a nice option to have.... Tasty! My go-to is always Chang’s spicy chicken., I have never had a problem with anything from the GF menu. Even mentioned Celiac and my server was even able to recommend a few things since she had tasted the GF specifically. Great experience every time!, They will use the normal soy sauce to boost profit... Not many... Gave me a severe celiac reaction. Frustrating for two reasons because the gluten free option costs more and of course the week-long fun that is feeling like death.... Their solution was to give me a gift card. Anyone want a gift card?, P.F.Chang was a great option for gluten free food. They have gone above and beyond to ensure you have an enjoyable experience. We ordered several gluten-free options but had no idea they provide gluten free sauces and soy sauce. Completely impressed by the food options.... Amazing! So many options and sauces for gluten free., — All food is gluten free, some drinks may not be gluten-free, Ordered out during quarantine. GF Chang’s chicken and GF pad Thai are specified on GF menu and marked with stickers, but we tested with Nima Sensor and both came back with Gluten Found. Maybe quality control was off given limited staff during Covid lockdown, not sure. But a bit unsettling. I think we have ordered and tested in past and tests came back ok, but I don’t remember exactly., I hope our experience is not normal, and I understand things are very different for all restaurants right now, but unfortunately the gluten free food we ordered was not gluten free. My son has been sick all day after our delivery last night. We'll have to see if he wants to give it another shot when the restaurants reopen for in person dining., I told the waiter I was GF with celiac and ordered a GF option, but the order that was brought to me was not GF. I ate a few bites before realizing that my plate was the same as everybody else’s. The waiter hadn’t even coded my order correctly on the ticket. He apologized saying he thought there wasn’t a difference in preparation between the regular and GF spicy chicken. Do not take your chances at this restaurant if you have celiac. It made me sick., Orders GF Mongolian Beef and Chicken Fried Rice. Both tested on Nima sensor as safe! Mongolian Beef was really tasty but the chicken fried rice didn’t taste like much as it lacked seasoning and enough tamari to add flavor. Heard the server at a table next door saying that they don’t put the edamame on the menu as GF because it comes pre-packaged and they can’t guarantee there wasn’t cross-contamination before they handle it. Their servers seemed well training on GF protocol and I liked how they use different plates to distinguish ... Went again and Nima teared GF Beef with Broccoli and think that was really good too, Went today and the server was very informed about our gluten allergy and all accommodations. Double checked each entree multiple times I was very happy with our service, Staff was aware of celiac. I had chicken fried rice it was delicious and great to be able to have restaurant fried rice again!, Not great
Brought me my meal NOT GF
Assured me the lettuce wraps I already ate were. I hope so already rumbling Oye! If you go here be careful!, Pad thai was delicious and not overpriced. Menu is clearly labeled, and staff knows what they’re doing, The staff is very knowledgeable and kind! I am a very sensitive Celiac and had no issue eating here.

Fries are not gf., It's nice to feel normal and enjoy the two handed burger! I was also informed that the fries are not cross contaminated... So I dug in!! I'm not verifying this for celiacs but if you're ok with the possibility...
Enjoy!!, offers Udi' s gf buns, Udis buns, overall kinda weak. Cold beer and cheeseburgers is about the same price and a better burger., I ate here for the first time and the staff told me they would use a dedicated fryer for fries.
Staff who took my order went in the back and double checked they were being careful and taking the right precautions., Worth it for the rosemary fries alone. Delicious. Pricey, but a fun splurge now and again, As usual a decent burger. Like others have said the staff is less than enthusiastic about being here., Gf buns and they put fries in separate fryer. I can have burger and fries again!!!!, Just ate here for second time with no problems. Fries with fry sauce are the best!, It was wonderful! The bun tasted ""normal!"" The manager was knowledgeable and most helpful!, Tried to give zero stars but it wouldn’t let me any way the food was super greasy and just nasty in general. I felt sick after eating there. Don’t waste your money I am not impressed, I’ve eaten here probably 50 times and I’ve got sick once.... Gluten free buns and sides... Eaten here probably 20 times and never been sick., Couldn’t see behind counter. Staff seem to understand that we had celiac. Cook nodded when she asked him to change gloves.... Fries are fried in a dedicated frier. They have Udis bun and they don’t grill them., I had the BBQ bacon and cheese burger with a gluten free bun (without the fried onion). It was delicious!, The staff is very knowledgeable. They use a separate fryer for their fries and have gluten-free buns available for burgers., Their gluten-free buns are so good! I live coming here because I always feel safe and the food is amazing! The fries are all gluten free and the workers are very knowledgeable!, Probably one of the best burger/fries combo I’ve had. Delicious, a fair amount of options and very knowledgeable about what was gluten free. They also were quick to ask for help if they didn’t know if something was or wasn’t gluten free., Best Smashburger I’ve been to for taking allergies seriously AND not messing up my order!! The staff was very knowledgeable about my gluten allergy. When I asked about changing gloves, etc, the cashier assured me they change gloves, clean the work surfaces and the grill. He double-checked to ensure they have a separate fryer for fries and tots (they do!). The cashier flagged my order and communicated it to the cooks. Order was served on a red plate. I felt very safe eating here!, They normally have a dedicated fryer and seemed very knowledgable about Celiac and took it seriously. Marked the orders clearly gluten free. Food was great!, They do offer a gluten free fryer but the people who work here seem miserable every time I go in and the service is absolutely terrible. Last time I ordered a double bacon avocado burger and it was missing the bacon, avocado, and the 2nd patty., They use Udi buns and are always careful when I say I have a gluten allergy. Good burgers-I have eaten here multiple times and never gotten sick, Never gotten sick, they have a dedicated fryer and very tasty buns., So good! As soon as I asked for a GF bun they went through the entire allergy protocol. Have safely eaten there 3 times. Burgers and fries are gf., They are always helpful and I wish I could still eat there, but I have felt sick the last 3 times I ate there. Definitely some serious cross-contamination happening despite the fact they always seem like they are taking precautions. I can’t risk trying to eat there anymore., Very knowledgeable. Grilled chicken with GF bun., Burger was pretty good. No complaints there especially when there is an Udi's bun. Staff was fairly knowledgeable and didn't make me feel like a burden. The only draw back is that the french fries are not gluten free so a meal is somewhat limited., Ate burger with GF bun. No issues!, We were told that there is possible cross-contamination with the cheese. So we just got the burger that was supposed to be gluten-free and the bun that was supposed to be gluten-free and they said they were super careful.... but my son still got sick.... very very sick..., I had a great experience. I had a breakfast sandwich on GF bun and smash tots. My food was clearly labeled with allergy markers., Awful! I wouldn’t recommend this place. No one in the restaurant was sure what was gluten free or not., Horrible food (except for their fries) and it there was almost always a risk of my brothers food being contaminated and the survive sucked., They didn’t have a gluten free bun, I got pretty sick after eating a gf burger here. Felt ok directly after but later at night very sick. Nauseated and dizzy for more than an hour., This location is amazing. I’ve been to many Smashburgers in multiple states and this one is the best. They take the time to make sure my food is safe. I go in often enough that they know me. They even toast my bun on the grill next to the burgers so it is safe and doesn’t go through the cross contaminated toaster. It’s worth the price for a good, celiac safe burger., Fantastic burger with Gfree bun! Fries were awesome too!, Cashier told me he had celiac and understood my pain and being hesitant to try something new. Dedicated fryer and burger was good. I did get a bun however instead of a lettuce wrap like I asked (Udis), I gave celiac's and I'm super sensitive. I ate there and I didn't get sick., Brought our regular burger. Just swapped it for a gluten free burger with all the same used toppings., Ceoliac safe and yummy. Awesome to beable to have the fries too. :-), I've had burgers on GF buns here twice with no reaction., Has a dedicated fryer! I only had fries, but the cashier took note of my “gluten allergy” (Celiac) and I didn’t get sick. I tend to play it a little safe when eating at restaurants, so I didn’t try a burger with GF bun or any sauces, so cannot vouch for those. But the staff seemed to listen and try their best to be accommodating., This place was great. Very knowledgeable and careful. If they weren’t sure (shakes) they said no which I appreciate greatly. Definitely good food and worth going to!!!, I hate Udis buns, so that kills it for me. I’ll stick to a salad next time. I wish places would realize that there are other GF bread options that taste a lot better., I think this is my favorite place to grab a cheeseburger! The gluten free buns are good and I was very satisfied with my order. I’m still confused about the fries, but I’ll ask again the next time I visit. The bacon was GF, too! (Celiac), Fries are gluten free and they have gluten free buns, Gluten free bun and dedicated fryer for French fries, I just mentioned that I need to have an allergy warning placed on my order for gluten because I have celiac disease. I had a burger with a gluten free bun withfries and didn’t have any problems., The staff was amazingly educated on being celiac. She even told the kitchen to not cross contaminate me and my boyfriends food. I was shocked of the education. Not on just not having gluten. But that she was educated on cross contamination.
As far as food options you can have any burger and they have gluten free buns. Buyers beware: gluten-free bun is $2.00 extra, I won’t recommended for celiac, depends on the cookers, won’t take a risk w/ taking my kids, they’d should be more serious about cross contamination’s if they’d are registered in find me gluten., I love the burgers here! I order the burgers with either a gluten free bun or with no bun. The grilled chicken is good too., The staff was awesome. She seemed very knowledgeable and helpful. They have all dedicated gluten-free fryers except one that they use for breaded products. They also had a great gluten-free bun and MAN was the truffle mushroom swiss burger amazing. I highly recommend and will be back! Did not get sick., Ordered GF, brought it out & the bread look different & we asked if it was gf, he gave us the thumbs up. After we’ve been eating a bit he brings out a burger & said we could take it home or something since we were almost done. It’s the gluten free!!!, They gave me a gluten bun and I didn't realize until halfway through eating it. Ended up in the hospital.

I did not get sick from either meal and food tasted good., Got sick here. Waitress had no idea about gluten and allergies. Told me the opposite of which items were GF. The staff needs better training., Tons of options. Staff was knowledgeable. Food was good., Had a great meal. Chips are safe to eat and there are many choices on the menu., Lots of gluten free options marked on the primary menu. Chicken tacos and guac we're tasty but not very special. Overpriced. Server was very knowledgeable., Very sensitive celiac, never been sick from eating here. Great happy hour, chips and salsa GF too (not fried), They have a menu with gluten free options , so I ordered 2 of them, and told the waiter i have Celiac desease.... when I tested them with my nima sensor both of them had gluten.... very unsafe, Wonderful meal (and margarita!) . Chips safe. Staff knowledgeable. Many items gluten free., Seafood and Mexican food. We had black and white nachos (that were lobster on blue corn chips with “double fried” spinach). My husband ordered fish tacos and I got the shrimp skewers with cilantro rice. The food was good if you like butter. I am only giving them 4 stars because to me seafood shouldn’t be heavy. My husband is also celiac and didn’t have reaction from cross contamination. Staff was knowledgeable and accommodating. GF food is their thing, and are super contentious., Went for the first time last night! Staff was very knowledgeable, the food was delicious, and we made it to the theatre on time!
In fact, it was so fantastic, we stopped in for dessert (try their gf peanut butter chocolate thing - it’s heavenly!) after the show!... Yum yum!, First time here and the menu and food is phenomenal!!, Love all of the gluten free options. We had a business table of 7, everyone a foodie, and everyone was very happy with their meal. Staff handled my gluten intolerance with knowledge and respect. We've already booked another reservation. This time it will be for 8 people., Extremely helpful and DELICIOUS food. Lots of great options and knowledgeable server., With a two page menu that is full of naturally GF & modified GF choices, no wonder this place was recommended by a fellow celiac at the Four Seasons hotel. Our entire non GF party enjoyed apps dinner & even dessert options most of which we'd ordered GF. Definitely go there! Be sure to tell them it's celiac so they avoid cross contamination or adding reg non gf items. Yum!, about half the menu was GF. another quarter could be made GF.

She had a GF burger, kids at whatever, I ate fries and cocktails. Fries were sorta hard, actually. But I didn't feel sick so that's good. Everyone was accommodating. Right next to Union Station, definitely had a tourist feel., Has bun. Lacks structural integrity if it gets too moist, but tasty, Very much enjoyed my meal. The bun was different but quite good. The burger was amazing. And there are so many flavors of fries. I believe I could order all of their menu with some modifications. ... Wish they were closer to home., The food was really good but I might have been cross contaminated by their condiments :(, Delicious! Gluten free fries and really good buns., Had a delicious GF burger and fries. Nothing with gluten goes into the fryer. The bun looks totally different so there’s no confusing it for a regular bun. It was delicious., How does this place not have more reviews? I’ve never felt confident at any other burger place (other than Red Robin) like I did here. This place beats RR tenfold. Ordering was a breeze...employee totally aware of GF needs and celiac. Acted as if it was no hassle at all. Had a lettuce wrapped classic burger, regular fries, and a local cider. Everything so good. Felt good after the meal. My husband (not celiac) got the GF bun said he was happy to have it over a regular bun! Will definitely come back if we’re in Denver again!, So nice to have a place that doesn't think Udi's is an acceptable bun! They are also committed to sourcing local ingredients, which is great., The BEST gluten free bun I have ever had, hands down! It was like a homemade country biscuit YUM!!!, Excellent food and service! Gluten free buns and fries! They know what celiac means. Our way to go every time we visit lower downtown., I have been a few times and have always had a great experience. The staff understands allergy requests and double checked things and kept me informed as needed. ... I thought the burgers were delicious. The bun isn't the best in the world but it's decent and tasty enough. Honestly the burger patties and toppings make up for any crumbles. Also have drink options and plain fries are safe., I told the server that I had celiac and she understood what that meant. I ordered the baby kale salad with an angus patty so I can't comment on the gluten free buns. It was delicious. The truffle fries were good but not as good as the ones at Coquettes's in Colorado Springs. They serve Kombucha!!! And their sodas are all an independent brand made with sugar and not corn syrup. There are many unique flavor options and all were delicious. (They let me sample) The place had a great vibe and great service. I will definitely go back., Bun is pretty crumbly, fell apart. But had no reaction from burger or fries, good drinks too, Makes their own GF buns. Fresh GF buns make all the difference. Knowledgable staff., They were great, the gluten-free bun for the burger was great., I had a mushroom burger and sweet potato fries. The GF bun wasn’t that great but, the rest of the burger and the fries were! Didn’t get sick., Staff is not careful. While they understand and acknowledge celiac and gluten allergies/ sensitivities, they are not overly concerned with changing gloves or cleaning surfaces. Ate here once and was fine, second visit I got incredibly sick after 2 bites of a burger with no bun.... Few gluten free options. Fries are gluten free, but burgers must be served on lettuce or on a plate.... Servers seem unhappy and it reflects in the service. Prices are high for what you get..., Ate there about a week ago- it was ok. GF bun is like a Hardees breakfast biscuit (from my non gf days). It was all cold when we got it (5 mins after scheduled time). Milkshakes were gross (gf and non gf). Didnt get sick- wouldn't go back., Read here that fries were safe but after eating them I can say they are NOT, We called ahead before ordering curbside, and also notated twice on our order it couldn’t have gluten contamination. My daughters box was marked, but an hour later and she’s sick :(.... Ordered a gf bun but got a patty with two pieces of lettuce., I don't like doing negative reviews, but based on everyone's 100% safe votes, I tried this place, and I'm hating life right now. The food was okay but expensive. I had to explain what Celiac disease was and why gluten free was imperative, to the young lady at the register and even though they filled out a red allergy card for my food to be safely made, I was definitely glutened. I would not recommend this restaurant if you have Celiac Disease. I'm not sure if someone there is new, and this was a fluke accident, but they sure jacked me up., Great options. Dedicated preparation for those with gluten/grain allergies or sensitivity and dedicated fryers. Decently knowledgeable and attentive staff. No negative reactions. Bread is made in house. GF bread is like an old fashioned made from scratch biscuit. My kids liked it but said it crumbles easily. All enjoyed., A little pricey for a burger, but great food and great options for gluten free. Dedicated frying mde French fries possible and they were from fresh potatoes vs frozen. I had a lettuce wrap and spouse had a gluten free bun. He said it was good. They use a red ticket that screams ""allergy"" to handling your food, to prevent cross contamination. I would eat here again., Eaten here so many times without incident. The staff seems to click into gear every time we mention a gluten allergy. They are knowledgeable of their menu and have successfully steered us clear of anything that would make us sick. Their burgers and fries are cooked to perfection on a safe griddle or in a gluten free fryer. They accommodate dairy free customers as well. Whether you get a gluten free bun or a lettuce wrap this is the place for you. I can’t think where else I’d rather have a burger. Seriously though., Wonderful experience from beginning to end. The gluten free bread didn't taste cardboard-y. Since they don't have onion rings, the fries are essentially fried in a gluten free oil. They even asked if I had a gluten allergy or dietary choice. Can't wait to go back. I am so happy that I have another place that is safe., Loved it. Didn't get sick at all.
Bun was good. All the fries were safe., Good Burger and Bun seems homemade!
Definitely going back. The fries weren’t to bad either. Dedicated fryer. Yay, The burger and gluten free bun were very good. I had no problem with the fries, I asked beforehand, they said it was a separate fryer. Truffle fries Yummm!, While the restaurant is not a GF facility, the staff took great care in making sure I did not get sick. They referenced the allergen menu for the sauces for me, gave me a GF bun for my burger, and I could eat the Parmesan truffle fries since they are not in a shared fryer. The guy who took my order went back to the kitchen staff to let them know of my celiacs so that they would be careful not to cross-contaminate. The food was delicious, and I did not get sick!, Always a pleasure to eat here and easy to order! The staff are always warm and courteous with our dietary requests. When ordering be sure to specify gluten-free and tell them it is for an allergy., Delicious burgers. Most items can be made gluten free. I was a little concerned about cross contamination, but thankfully didn’t get sick., Love this place! They have gluten free buns for their burgers and a fryer for the fries., Delicious!!!! Knowledgeable staff & good GF buns. Will go back!, Excellent gluten free bun and they have gluten free fry options, also. Some of the sauces are gluten free as well., We sat at the bar and ordered which was much easier to explain my needs! The bartender looked up in the ingredients book they have if the salads had any gluten and said any burger could be made GF! I had no reaction and it was still delicious. I got the mushroom burger with a lettuce bun., Love the gluten free bun, sauces, salads. Veggie burger is also gluten free. My fav burger in town. Been many many times and never fallen sick., Found this restaurant with my Find Me Gluten-free app. The burgers were great and the staff was knowledgeable with gluten-free practices. They have a dedicated fryer and a selection of fries. Definitely worth a return trip., The lady at the counter says they have a dedicated fryer for just fries. I said I heard they have gluten in the fryer and she says no, they don’t. ... I wish they would get a location near me!, WARNING UPDATE: THEIR FRYERS ARE NO LONGER DEDICATED. They now cook hush puppies made with flour in there. ... After reading positive things about multiple locations nationwide, I called this restaurant to ask their protocols in place. I was so impressed. They start with a red ticket for any allergy and the kitchen staff knows that means to get fresh gloves and fresh utensils etc. Buns are made in-house and are tasty. Tons of types of GF fries to chose from. Staff very knowledgeable and willing to accommodate and look up if anything like a sauce is for sure GF.... Have eaten at this location multiple times without issue., I was very hesitant to eat here based on the reviews on here. However, I went during an off time and had a very good experience. I researched online, as well as spoke with the manager here. He said all of their fries are fried in a dedicated fryer. He said all burgers are safe (sans bun), aside from some of their specialty burgers they do on occasion. They have a gf bun, or lettuce wrap options. I asked about prep of the burgers and the manager said the gluten buns have their own separate warmer. Everything on the grill is gf. I tried the good night/ good cause burger with the gluten free bun, along with the parmesan fries. The burger was juicy with their signature ""sassy"" sauce. Caramelized onions and jalapenos topped it off. The bun was tasty and soft. However, it didn't quite hold up to being a handheld. The fries were tasty and came with forks to handle the mess. Most importantly, I didn't get sick. I'm not sure how they handle gf in busy crowds, but during this off time, I had a wonderful experience and will be back., Dedicated fryer for French fries. They fill out a Red Food Allergy form for your food once you identify your allergy and have a separate space for food preparation. Would eat here again, it was great., This place is celiac friendly :), Just had my first experience here. Best gluten free burger I have had in the last 5 years. Bun is delicious and burger moist. I am only in town a week but I will be going back again., I tested the GF hamburger bun with my Nima Sensor and it tested safe. Had a classic burger and French fries, which they said would be fried in a separate fryer. My food came out marked with a red allergy ticket. It was delicious and I had no side effects at all., I eat gluten free just for healthy reasons. This place has by far the best burger on gluten free bun in OKC. I’ve had many different ones at various restaurants. It’s fantastic., Nice place, has an eclectic vibe. Clean. Very Celiac friendly, the staff new what I was talking about. The burger was great and the GF bun was really good. The shake was superb! Highly recommended. Definitely coming back when in Houston., You can have a Burger on gluten free bun and the French fries are 100 percent gluten free. The only thing in the fryer is the French fries. This is celiac friendly :), Fries are no longer gluten free! I got sick last time because they didn’t mention the change in shared fryer when I told them about my allergy. Do not recommend., The bun is GROSS here. It falls apart immediately. The fries are what I go for and they never dissapoint, My experience was not great. The burger is underwhelming with no flavor. The gluten free bun is very large and too sweet to compliment a burger. The side salad is prepackaged and there is no quality control in kitchen as carrots had that white haze from being old and lettuce was beyond wilted when it turns black & slimy. On the flip side, the staff was friendly and they do have an allergen booklet. I was told there is not a separate fryer...be careful from what you read on previous reviews., They have GF buns but when I asked about the fries they said that they are fried in the same fryer as the hush puppies. Warning!! I’ve been reading all about them being GF and celiac friendly and was surprised to learn that, Staff knew about celiac and flagged the order to be extra careful with the burger bun, however they no longer have a dedicated fryer so none of the fries are safe., This place is not gluten free. To much cross contamination. I saw the guy in back handling all the burger as well as the gluten free ones without bothering to change his gloves. So basically he grabbed 4 none gluten burgers before touching my gluten free burger and on top of that he also touched my fries after he touched all the other burgers. I specifically even gave them instructions about my allergy.If you have a celiac disease don’t eat here you’ll probably get sick. I won’t be eating here any more. It’s not worth the risk. I had to throw away the bread and just eat the meat which was basically pointless when ordering a gluten free bun., This is one of my favorite places to take my son who has celiacs. There careful with his food and everything on the menu is delicious., Decent place for burgers, they can modify most items for allergies. They were out of GF buns the first time we went, and we were told the fries are cross contaminated, no separate fryer., So very careful with allergies. A red allergy ticket is created when you order beef is ground on premises so very fresh. They bake their own buns and gluten free are kept separate. Cut their own fries and they are fried in a dedicated fryer. My husband is very sensitive and has never had an issue. They are knowledgeable about their ingredients and my multiple allergy child can eat as well. Bonus the food is delicious as well!, I read all these great reviews but my experience was terrible. The food was good but I got very, very sick eating there., Still a great place for a great burger. Asked and found out the Chipotle ketchup was gluten free. Will be back again!, WARNING: THEIR FRYERS ARE NO LONGER GF DEDICATED. They changed their menu recently and now they cook hush puppies in the fryer. Also the manager lacked knowledge and tried to tell me I was more likely to get gluten breathing their air than eating fries out of their shared fryer. 🙄 Even the burger ended up having cross-contamination. ... I was sooooooooo disappointed because my last experience (at NH location) was so perfect. 😩, Hopdoddy’s is one of my favorite restaurants in Austin! They have amazing gluten free buns so that any burger can be made gluten free :) delicious milkshakes and truffle fries too!!, They are so so great at gluten free. They have a special allergy card they give the chef and their gluten free bun is quite good. I've eaten here 5 times and haven't gotten sick yet!, This review is really my fault, but is a warning. I’m gluten sensitive but not celiac & I ordered the “Impossible” plant-based burger & GF bun & responded (to her question) that GF was a preference vs allergy to spare them the CC discussion since I’ve eaten there before & love it. Do NOT order this “impossible” plant-based burger, I loved eating it on the yummy GF bun & the sweet potato fries I’ve had before, but this plant-based “burger” gave me the most severe gluten reaction I’ve ever had (extreme indigestion) & turns out to have wheat, yeast extract, etc. I ordered it on a GF bun, but never asked if it was GF, my fault although I wish the order counter person had mentioned the gluten ingredients (ingredients were not on the menu). Great food & service (love the GF buns!) but stay away from the plant-based, yummy Impossible burger!, By far the best gluten-free buns I've had. Nice texture, flavor, and sturdiness.

GFCO is studying these enzyme beers and there’s no evidence that any gluten is removed. It’s a lazy way for a brewery to go after the gluten-free market. Made me sick for 3 weeks., The best thing I've ever discovered since being diagnosed as a Celiac. I know that there is some controversy with gluten-removed beers, but I'm very sensitive myself and have never gotten a reaction from Rickoli's.

I've eaten here a few times and have never had symptoms like this, so may have been an off day in the kitchen. However, based on similar reviews, it seems like they're not the most consistent about allergies. ... Delicious food, tons of options (including a gluten/dairy free dessert that isn't sorbet!!). Love the ramen and the impossible burger. I've never ordered something here that wasn't spot on., Incredible food and all allergy friendly!, I was extremely excited to go here after reading reviews, but I got really sick afterwards.... I wrote on the reservation that I had celiac and told the waiter I had a severe gluten allergy when I was seated. I had the chicken lettuce wraps, lamb kebabs, and one of the desserts. The lamb kebabs came out on flour pitas, so I quickly sent them back and everyone at the table was given a free shot of liquor to make up for the mistake.... It was obvious after leaving the restaurant that the waiter must not have marked the appetizer or dessert gluten free as well because I was sick that night and the entire next day., Been here several times and food is great! Just
Let them know you have celiac and they will take great care of you!, Had the sweet potato fries and a shrimp appetizer on the rooftop pub. Really great atmosphere!, I'm a sceptic, sensitive celiac. Got the ramen, delicious and safe!, I was really impressed by this place on paper, and after grabbing a drink on the rooftop bar, I felt really excited to try the restaurant below. They were so thoughtful about celiacs, food allergens and dietary restrictions in general. But when I tested their Vietnamese Crepe dish with my NIMA sensor and gluten was found, it all went downhill for me. Our waiter was sweet as pie and willing to help out in whatever way he could, but the manager came out to speak to me and was very condescending. She insisted that there was no absolute way that there was gluten in the dish since it was made with gf ingredients. She didn't care what my ""little sensor"" said, insisted the line staff agreed that it was impossible that there was any cc, and so on. She left and came back a second time to insist they weren't at fault, but they could bring me something else. I had already lost my appetite at that point, and already had another order of food that I could test and eat. They were the new yellowfin tuna tostadas, which ended up being safe and amazing, but the prior interactions with the manager ruined it for me. It stinks to have a disease where you get violently ill if you ingest even trace gluten, and then to be treated like that. The food that was safe was very tasty, though. The waiter was apologetic, but the manager was rude. And I feel like managers are usually our main allies in safe eating experiences at restaurants. I don't live in Denver, but if I did, I wouldn't go back based that treatment alone. Should I come back and find gluten found on a Nima reading, I don't need to be shamed by the restaurant. I think it was a blow to their pride, but still it wasn't acceptable., Really fun vibrant (loud) environment. Make reservations or try for a booth in the bar. Sweet potato fries. Dosa., Linger was a fantastic experience. Well trained staff and wonderful food. A good portion of the menu was already GF!, My son took me to brunch here and I had the adobo pork benedict. Absolutely delicious! Cool atmosphere and great views. Highly recommend!, I am going to be fat and happy for a month after my meal at Linger. Excellent gf notations on the menu. Went on Tuesday for the 3 courses for $30. Definitely worth it. I wanted to bribe the chef to teach me how to make the Vietnamese crepe made from coconut and rice flour (vegan). The Thai fried rice was the best I've ever had and the gluten free dessert trio and Thai snow were the perfect end to a great meal., Love it here. Great BBQ tacos and I've always felt like they take special care when you talk to them about your restrictions., Hands down the best GF sliders I've ever had. Awesome choices and a fun environment. Will be back!, I ate lunch at Linger yesterday (7/22/15) and woke up this morning with the obvious signs that I had been glutened. I made it very clear to the staff that it was an allergy and not just a request. I will never eat here again after the many hours of pain I went though. such a shame that a ""fancy"" place like this can't even provide truly gluten free food., Great service! Selection of yummy GF options and felt safe and reassured by staff. No signs of reaction after!, Hands down the best restaurant and I have fined in many fine dinning spots. Incredible flavor, exceptional service, perfect ambiance and the view is refreshing :) love this place!
Our server, nick was amazing!, I was not impressed. the food did not make any type of impression. I can't even say it was seasoned well, or much at all. this place is overhyped.... on a positive note, my husband liked the sliders., This place is amazing.

Was so happy to be able to order anything I wanted from a menu without fear of cross contamination!, Menu is clearly labeled. Wait staff could have been more knowledgeable but food was delicious. Can’t beat happy hour prices!, Edited August 21st 2020. So it turns out they are using imitation crab. I don't know if that's a covid-19 or if that's an always thing but be careful of the crab. Maybe they will lose the attitude when we ask about gluten-free items now. So disappointed.
Celiacs beware!! I'm so sad. I have celiac disease and with that am very limited to what I can eat. Bamboo has always been very good about telling customers about gluten in their food. Usually it's very safe, as they assure us it is. So much so we eat here at least once a week. We happen to eat there last night (June 7th, 2020). It was all I wanted after a 3 day fast. We ordered the rolls we always do, the ones we know are safe. I started getting sick within 30 minutes of finishing dinner. I haven't had this bad of a reaction in a very long time, which means I ingested a considerable amount of gluten. If you don't have any dietary restrictions with gluten please enjoy it, the food is absolutely amazing. If you are Celiac however please really consider whether or not to eat here. ❤, Entire menu is gluten free by default — they actually label what has gluten rather than the other way around. Also very helpful in finding dairy free and soy free options! Sushi is EXCELLENT. Jared was so helpful!!, Awesome place. Everything but 2 items (both buns) is gluten free. Safe fryer. Safe desserts. And really good and fresh sushi. Highly recommend., Flipping amazing!!! Everything on the menu is GF except 2 items. All sweets are GF. The staff are wonderful!!!, Almost entirely gluten free menu. Super good good. Fryer is safe. Tempura and cauliflower is bomb, Incredible experience. Everything was gluten free except buns because the owner had celiac. One of the best experiences I’ve had since diagnosis., I felt unwell in a gluteny way immediately after eating here, but am not sure why. As others note the menu is mostly GF. We had veggie tempura, fried cauliflower, some sushi, cucumber salad, shishitos.
I had a searing neck headache when I got to the car, later calmly threw up 2/3 of my meal, then fell asleep without noticing at 9 pm. This makes me suspect gluten., You know when you go to a sushi place and you're like ""damnit! I should be able to eat everything because soy sauce should actually be made of soy and tempura should be rice flour!"". This is the place you've been dreaming of., My favorite place to visit when in Portland. Staff is knowledgeable and as mentioned nearly everything is GF. The fried Philly roll on the happy hour menu is delicious!, Right when I walked in, I asked the host about their ability to accommodate the needs of people with celiac disease. Without missing a beat, she picked up the menu and showed me the only two unsafe items on the menu, the burger and the vegetable buns. The entire rest of the menu is gluten free! She explained that all of the soy sauce used is gluten free tamari, and they even have gluten free tempura! When I was seated I asked the server a few more questions just to be sure and he assured me that I was safe and that they take gluten-free needs very seriously. I had the eel, the black cod, and a couple of awesome rolls. Everything was delicious, fresh and beautiful. It felt wonderful to eat there without worry., Nearly entire menu is gluten free (only a few things contain gluten and that's what's marked on the menu. Their panko is gluten free and only gluten free things go in the fryer so it's safe. Also good miso (add the truffled mushroom it's worth it). Tamari is used standard. Super good food. We will be back., Without a doubt the most Celtic friendly sushi in Seattle. We were totally blown away that everything was safe but found out this was due to the owner being celiac. Shrimp tempura rolls!?!?, Had a bunch of sushi rolls and tempura at a party that were made from Bamboo Sushi. I was pretty skeptical but called the restaurant to confirm that what we had was GF. I wish I ate more. It was all so good, but I didn’t know if I could trust it. Felt totally fine afterwards and now am really looking forward to stopping in for dinner sometime soon!, Wide range of choices for those with celiac. Fresh, delicious and expertly prepared. Any location in Portland metro will not disappoint., Had chicken karaage, sunset role and nw philly in happy hour. Great food and drinks. Most of the items are gluten free. Sweet cream panna cotta was ok. Loved the black sesame brownie. Overall great experience., All menu items but a few are gluten free! The tempura and chicken karaage (fried chicken) were tasty. Servers were knowledgeable. The yuzu mochi crunch cake was the amazing too. Will be back!, This is my favorite sushi place. They never disappoint and most of the menu is GF. Highly recommend them!, Very safe. The only thing with gluten on their menu is an american burger, which I've never seen ordered., Fantastic sushi! Almost all of the menu is GF, including the fryer and all of the soy sauce., Amazingly delicious and creative food, and you can feel safe eating here for sure. Our waiter was very comfortable discussing gluten intolerance and told us that only two things on the menu contain gluten: a burger entree (the bun, which can be substituted), and a steamed bun appetizer. The fryer is safe so you can order delicious tempura. ALL sauces they use or prepare for the sushi rolls or other entrees are gluten free. Our server even came back to give us some unique information about the Inari Nigiri (the tofu pocket around a rice roll), which we had ordered. He said at another sushi restaurant where he had worked, the tofu is pre-marinated in a ponzu/soy sauce that contained wheat. He checked with the chef at Bamboo to confirm their Inari is truly gluten free. Wow! Thank you to Bamboo Sushi for doing this - I only wish more Asian restaurants would get on board and source their soy sauce ingredients to eliminate the gluten! You may also be pleasantly surprised here if you are looking for a great vegetarian meal - their vegetarian/vegan rolls are very good, not to mention the veggie tempura., Excellent sushi and excellent options. Waiter and staff were well informed and had no problem double checking that the fryer was dedicated, etc.
The Tempura is gluten free! They only serve tamari sauce and real crab in their rolls. Highly recommend!, Excellent sushi! Their menu is clearly marked with only two items containing sushi. Well worth the price!, Almost every single item is gluten free! It’s nice having the opportunity to eat sushi again without any worry. Very safe and would highly recommend!, All but a couple of things gf, including the fryer!!! Watch out for beers, but everything else was really clear, 5 stars for gluten handling, but took one off for price /quantity. Sushi was excellent, tasty, and tender, but very small. Great on gluten, they have Tamari sauce on all the tables, all rolls and even tempura is GF., This place is great. Only 3 items on the menu that have gluten, excluding some alcoholic beverages. I’ve been going here awhile now and have always loved it but now that their menu has been update this shit is next level. So so good., I’m always on the lookout for gf sushi when I travel, and this really hit the spot. Only a few items on the menu contain gluten and they are clearly marked - everything else is gf. Great service and friendly staff, too. Wish I lived here so I could eat here all the time., They recently changed their menu so that everything is gluten free unless indicated. No regular soy sauce, only tamari at tables. Tempura is also all gf now. I think pretty much all the food is gluten free except for buns and burger. Also it’s really good sushi. One million stars!, Many items on menu are just gluten free, no longer need to be modified to be gluten free (changed 2-3 months ago) Gluten free tamari on tables, use gluten free tempura, etc. Gluten free fryer. Sustainable, no MSG, no GMOs. Super yummy. I especially love the hoke poke box!, So fun to go to a sushi place where the gluten items are labeled instead of the gluten ones. Loved it. Yum!, This was so delicious. Definately not your usual sushi choices. And I was so excited to find out that most everything is gluten free. They have only the items with gluten marked on the menu. We tried nigiri that was dressed with different seasonings. Not like anything we'd had before, we were slightly leary, but it was very good. The tempura green bean roll was delicious with tuna on it.

This staff and location is my favorite of all the bamboo locations, they know the menu and allergens and take care of you., I have Celiac and the staff clearly told me what I could have off the gluten free menu. No reaction. Please note any gluten free dish with fried ingredients (tempura) shares a fryer with gluten dishes so NOT Celiac safe.

The stuffed poblano pepper and choriqueso (sort of a paste of chorizo and cheese) are fantastic, and as other reviewers have noted this is NOT your average flan - flan is normally something where I can take it or leave it, but theirs is incredible. Also make sure you eat plenty of the house hot salsa.... Servers are generally knowledgeable, just make sure you:... a) specify gluten-free chips, as the house chips are not gf... b) ask about the rice, as sometimes it is gf (not sure what they add to it exactly to make it not gf, but that's what I was told), Excellent food!

Ordered drinks. Got seated at a table where we were served by a different server - both seemed very knowledgeable by the way - who asked me if I was celiac [level of sensitivity] and I always say yes in these situations because it's code for how serious a place takes cross contamination. He served the mussels and informed me, unprompted, that I couldn't actually have them and that there's tons of cross contamination in their kitchen. Good thing my friend could eat them! They offered a salad and gluten free bread, which was delicious. Their pasta - a fettuccine - was especially good and the sauce they were in was to die for. I took an enzyme that's supposed to help digest gluten as soon as I started on the salad... And I've only had mild symptoms afterwards. The admission of cross contamination scared me, as well as the fact that we only caught the mussels as we were being served. I was expecting it to be more celiac or allergy friendly. I'd probably go back, risk it again for the insanely good flavors. But it may not be the best for severe sensitivity or celiac. Good luck!, Best GF pasta I have ever had. Truly amazing.

They were delicious!!, Knowledgable staff and wonderful food. This is totally foodie Mexican at its best. Highly recommend taco tuesdays! They have a rotating menu of small, street tacos which are $1 on tuesdays and they’re always incredible!, Amazing farm to table Mexican food! Only 1 menu item isn't gluten free. I could eat here every day.","snowandsunmama,av8trix,Chelsea,Britt Trinta",CO,2,0,3,80211

Things are clearly marked. I was not impressed with the quality of the food., OMG.......so delicious! Very celiac aware, lots of choices and fantastic service. Our server Abbey suggested the clementine arugula salad and the street taco sampler....... amazingly tasty! The chips are not made in a designated fryer so I couldn't have them but they allowed me to go across the street and buy some chips to bring in!!! The guac is to die for, fresh and tasty and salsas are equally yummy! Can't wait to come back!!!, Everything is made with corn tortillas (even the quesadillas). Very good Mexican food, highly recommend., The do have GF options here, and my server was helpful and knowledgeable. However many of the items on the menu that are noted as GF are NOT GF because the shared fryer. My server helped me pick out items that are actually GF and double checked with the kitchen. Food was pretty good., Labeled menu for GF and staff is knowledgeable about celiac. There are many great options. For celiac - stay away from the chips. They’re made in a shared fryer., Celiac friendly for sure. Just not the best Mexican food I’ve ever had. Not a terrible place, but not my top 5 for Mexican food even., Seemed celiac friendly with some options and the waitress was very knowledgeable about what to inform celiac customers but unfortunately they only have one frier so simple things like chips were not gf for celiacs (super sad bc the nachos looked great)., Our favorite things here are carnitas and the jalapeño poppers ordered with habanero sauce. Great margaritas. Good cal/Tex style mexican and fun for date nights. You might get., Loved their food before diagnosis however they list items as gluten free in their menu but then they share the same fryer as the breaded items. Even the non fried items that are naturallg gf such as street tacos can easily be cross contaminated. Staff was very knowledgeable about the kitchen and we both decided that it was not safe for me to eat there., Awful. Marked GF stuff all over the menu but no clarity as to what was actually GF, what was prepared on shared grill space/fryers, etc. Mixed messages from wait staff, was told chips were and weren't fried within 10 mins. Do NOT go here if you're celiac or gluten sensitive., I have a husband who has celiac disease, and the kitchen here is not safe. They warned us multiple times that the kitchen will cause cross-contamination. DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU ARE CELIAC. The menu repeatedly says it's ""GF,"" but please do not believe that as in their whole kitchen is contaminated. I can't believe they would falsely advertise that they have gluten free dishes. Also, the waitress we had was totally scattered-brained and didn't know what she was doing, and made us wait 33 mins for a simple margarita.... DO NOT GO HERE., Celiac friendly. The spicy Mexican shrimp in the habanero sauce with jalapeño polenta is amazing!!! Do not eat the chips. Not sure if they fry them there with other items in a shared fryer or what but I got sick from those.
Other than that though, our visits have always been great. Also only the black beans are meat free., I’ve always had good luck and haven’t ever gotten ill after eating here. The gf cocktails are great. Oh, and the food— it’s really, really good! Service isn’t always the most desirable, but it’s so worth it., Limited menu, ask lots of questions. Had their chicken street tacos and chicken soup., Not that many options for celiacs if you’re being careful about shared surfaces., Waitress and manager were not put out from my questions but they treated me like I was someone who would go postal any second, even though I was being totally nice, as I was with on a work dinner with coworkers. The waitress said their fryer for chips was a shared fryer but I questioned how they could call their nachos gluten free (printed on the menu) as such. The manager was called over who treated me the same way...as if I was someone from a psych ward, that would freak out any second (so weird...never been treated like that before). He said it was NOT a shared fryer and ultimately, I did not get sick. But, I won’t be back. Food was just average...could have gotten that level of food from a food truck., Not safe for celiac. Waitstaff point blank told me not to order with true allergies. Gluten free options on menu if not celiac., Servers are knowledgeable about GF and are very accommodating. I’ve never had any problems. I usually order tacos and rice and beans, or a salad. Can’t speak for the rest of the menu. FYI, the chips are made in a shared fryer, so those are off limits for GF., Let me start by saying I have Hashimoto's, not Celiac, so staying away from gluten is important, but worrying about cross contamination is not as big of a worry for me. That said, they have one fryer that is used for everything. ( As a regular, I'm going to try to change that by being a squeaky wheel). ... I have been a regular for 7 years and was only recently diagnosed, so I'm happy I can still hang out here. It is true their menu is limited, but it is labeled and can be easily customized to your liking. My favorite appetizer is the stuffed jalapeños, and right now ( it's summer) I am loving the Strawberry salad that I order with extra strawberry, and added shrimp and avocado! The wait staff and cooks are knowledgeable about the menu and can help you make safe choices. Might I also recommend their Margarita? 😉, Chips are not friendly cooked in same fryer as the calamari. West Seattle Matador uses a separate fryer. They only have one fryer in Tacoma, need to change the breading to gluten free on the calamari. Otherwise you have a few choices., soo good. server knew what to avoid, Sicker than a dog. Don't chance it if you have celiac., Gluten free menu sucks as you can get a gluten free chip. Their gf sandwiches don't have bread or any substitute (shar buns?). Also udi's gluten free tortillas are amazing.... Was very disappointed. This is not a gluten free friendly restaurant. Will be checking back for changes because the restaurant is very nice., they are very knowledgeable about gluten sensitivity and their gluten free menu indicates items that are fried in shared oil, WOW! I ate here last night for the first time and I can't tell you how impressed I am with my server, manager and chef. All worked to make sure my food (I have celiac disease) was safe and delicious for me. I will definitely go back!, Love that they have many GF options on their menu. The GF quesadillas are delicious!, so very tasty!! absolutely a great spot will continue to go back.. GF menu is large, food is fresh and flavorful. They say they are Tex-Mex and I had avoided them for years because of it (not a tex mex fan!) i would never think of them as Tex Mex as much as just foodie/gourmet mexican. grab some friends and head over there now!","ATXGFDF,Julie ,Megan,Alisa,Emily,Chris,Sarah-Jane,Christy,Mandy,Jeff B,Lisa,Melanie,Hannah,Mardianne,Rebecca,Monica H.,Katie,Sabrina,Kelly,Andrew,kaila,kcrum,Rita hogan,Paige,Jesse,JulieW,User",CO,11,6,18,80211

I’m obsessed with the quest y frijoles tacos 😋, Celiac's beware: Staff is a little forgetful and we were delivered a gluten rich pizza that had bubbles in the crust that is too good to be GF. Also they prepare GF pizzas in same area as the gluten products. So be careful! I'm not celiac, so I can't handle a little cross contamination. When they got the GF pizza to us, the crust was really, really good. It had a nice spongey texture that is hard to find for GF. They also have fun toppings. This place also has tacos and only 2 on the entire menu are not GF. I enjoyed this place and would eat there again.

As I ate my beef pad thai I found shrimp (I specifically requested no shrimp), so that’s when I really started to worry. Now today I am super sick and definitely glutened. Beware of delivery I guess., Delicious! Many gluten free dishes, cooked separately., GF satay chicken is delicious. Haven't gotten sick and we eat there all the time. Just make sure to get their items that are GF., Great flavor and good selection of Gluten Free items. the best Tom Gah in Denver., I've eaten here probably about 20 times since moving to Denver and have never had an issue.

Even better, no gluten reaction., I am in Denver for work, and this was my first stop after settling in. They have a clearly labeled menu, great service, and an excellent Pad Thai! Will definitely be back again., Clear gf menu good amount. Pad Thai is the best on Denver very flavorful alway good service and price. Tom yum is good too. I hear its vegan without fish sauce. I hope so. I drive 35 miles one way to eat here, Not sure what happened - had a takeout order clearly marked gluten free (with gluten allergy), but had a classic reaction to the food. We ordered Pad Thai Woon Sen (bean thread noodle) and Massaman Curry., Delicious! Lots of GF options on the menu. I ordered GF Pad Thai and explained that I have celiac. Also ordered some veggie spring rolls that were GF but I used my own GF peanut sauce just to play it safe (we got the order to go)., Food was great! The wine wasn’t good so I will order tea next time. Items are marked GF and GF vegan., We just ate there last night and I was in pain all night. The staff did not take it seriously when I told them, it felt like they didn’t understand., Unfortunately had to leave. They label food items GF, however all items are cross contaminated. Same fryer and same wok used., Absolutely amazing gluten free pad thai. Menu is clearly marked, and staff understand celiac. This is my go-to!, amazing food! menu is clearly labeled. I had a soup and a curry, with no complaints about either. would absolutely eat here again!, I ate their twice and got sick twice. I had the GF pad thai on a Wednesday and was sick for almost a week. I thought it might have been another restaurant. So I went back again 9 days later on a Friday. Had the peanut curry with chicken. Sick again. This time much worse. Both times I went was around 7 at night. They clearly mark things gluten free and on both occasions the server said the items are prepared gluten free, not substitutions. So...there must be cross contamination. There's a bit of a language barrier there so not sure how much they know about preparing things in separate pans, avoiding cross contaminant free cooking. There's a ton of soy sauce being used for sure. If you order the side item of steamed vegetables, they are literally drowning in soy sauce, which I didn't touch of course. It may be a safe place for less strict GFers but if you're a Celiac or have a gluten zero diet, I would swing on down the road to somewhere else. Danger danger., Awesome pad thai!!!!, Amazing gluten free Pad Thai ever !!!! Great customer service make sure you try it, A few good dinner selections. But some of the curries have sauce that is so heavy and one can only eat so much Pad Thai. They need to find a way to do a gluten free stir fry or something., This place is delicious. This is my go to place when I go out with friends who are not gluten free. Tom Ka Gai is my favorite soup and both the pad thai and the curries are great. Definitely recommend., Never had a problem here. Been coming here for years. Always enjoy their pad Thai and never had any pain.

Got a steak and a baked potato and had no issues., When I went to place my order I stated this is an allergy order for gluten (easier than explaining celiac) and the very rude lady cut me off and said, we can’t guarantee anything is gluten free. I said I referred to your allergy menu before ordering and she said, nothing is safe anything could be cross contaminated. She was so rude and unhelpful and my son felt embarrassed because he hates to feel like he is the reason people with him can’t eat. I asked her why they even have an allergy menu but she didn’t seem to understand the question., Went here for dinner the other night and had the BBQ Nachos.

Adding this place to my personal list if celiac safe places in this area., Waiter was not knowledgeable about GF options and had to keep going back and forth to get questions answered. Fryer is not dedicated. GF options not indicated on menu. We were given an extensive spreadsheet listing all the food allergens in each menu item so a lot of back and forth research. Followed by being told fryer wasn’t dedicated so GF fried items weren’t GF after all. We managed a meal and hope it was safe but we will not bother coming back., All staff are very knowledgeable. I have only had reactions when I use the sauce on the table (I like sauce so I ask for extra in a bowl). I only ever have the nachos or potato, my sister has the chicken., Get sick when I eat here :( the smoked chicken was the last offender., Always check the box that your GF meal is in.

We left and went to another place., Chose from the allergy menu and knew within two hours that my meal was not 'gluten free'..., Delicious beyond words...all the sauces were gluten free. Service was prompt and super friendly. Only downside was the allergen menu is more old fashioned chart style and less user-friendly. Well worth the effort however., Our waiter had no idea what gluten was. I ordered off of the GF menu I found online but, still ended up getting sick after eating here., Great food. Had options for gluten free meals and sided., Was very pleased the times that we have been there to eat. Many choices for my 11 year to pick from. The wait staff was very helpful and insured that they would advise the chefs. All of our food was great and my kid loved her food and had no issues., I’ve eaten here numerous times and never gotten sick. They have an allergen menu list and the bbq sauce is GF, Had the pulled pork, potato salad and Cole slaw. Fryer is not dedicated so chips and fries are not celiac safe. Overall, waitress and food were fantastic., So, I'll preface this by saying, this location has great service and I can tell they care. They want to get it right. But I have to be honest, I did have a very, very mild reaction when I came home. Probably the most mild reaction I've had, just feeling slightly nauseous. I was able to sleep it off overnight though, felt great this morning. I'm wondering if it was the homemade chips...that's my suspicion. But your mileage may vary!, They have a comprehensive allergen menu, and the waiter assured us that the cooks take measures to avoid cross contamination. We were able to eat here with no issues., This was one of the worst experiences I've had in a long time. Their gluten-free ""menu"" is a long list of allergens. French fries say they are GF but then they tell me that the fryer is contaminated. After switching my order up to be as safe as possible, I still ended up with the worst gluten reaction I've had in a while and the food was very low quality. My brisket was about 75% fat. Very disappointing and will not be returning., Ordered a gluten free meal to go and they put cheesey muffins in the box.... enough said., Very knowledgeable. Separate gf allergen list.

The waitress dropped off chips, shouted something at us and walked away; my husband thought that meant they were gluten free, so I tried some only for her to deliver gluten free chips right after.

The waitress warned me if we come back again to only accept my food if it comes in the yellow ceramic dishes because that's what the kitchen uses for gluten free....

Definitely come early or plan to wait a while (you can use their app to get yourself on the list). I was by myself so was able to get a seat at the bar on a Saturday at around 8am. I was served quickly but the food took almost 20 minutes to come out. I got the pancake trio in gluten free with blueberry, peach, and pineapple upside down and it was to die for, as usual with their other locations. The “bartenders” were kind and apologized for the long wait, and gave me utensils and a to go box. Love being able to eat celiac safe for breakfast in Denver! The food comes out with a gluten free stick and they prep separately., This was fantastic during a vacation in Denver. We ate here twice... first time I got the blueberry danish pancakes and the second time I got the breakfast tacos on corn tortillas. Whenever you mention being gluten free they ask if it’s for allergy/celiac or preference. They do wash down and clean the cook top for the pancakes but I didn’t get sick and I’m celiac, What a cool place! This was definitely the best part of my trip to downtown Denver. I'm celiac and did not get sick from the AMAZING eggs Benedict and pancake flight. YUM., Always a great experience, my son and I love this place., We had been to the Lone Tree location once before. I loved the selection. Ordered GF sweet potato pancakes. Within a short time of finishing breakfast I became very sick... I had been glutened. I was sick all that day. I called Snooze the next morning - just to let them know what happened. I wasn’t looking to get anything out of it. Very disappointed with their lack of response. Hostess said she would have a manager call me. No apology, no concern. Never got a call. This was back in early December. I had written a Google review right away but forgot to post here. I will never go back., Staff is very knowledgeable and will let you know what you may not be able to make gluten free. My pancake flight came out with a stick marker reading gluten free making me feel even better!, I love Snooze, you can get almost anything GF and they're very helpful. All the delicious flavors of pancakes are available GF, and the staff is very knowledgeable., Come here every year when visiting Denver. I always get some sort of Eggs Benedict (they serve on gf toasted bread, not a gf English muffin) and the blueberry pancake with the lemon filling. I can’t eat more than half of it but it is awesomely good! Never been glutenized!
BTW I found ur today you can get just 1 egg and a single pancake order. 😀, I explained my sensitivity very thoroughly each of the three times I ate here and even used a wrapped set of to go utensils. Though I got several looks from the servers, I never got sick and really enjoyed their delicious chocolate chip pancakes and fruit., This place is fantastic for Celiacs just as I've found all Snooze to be. food is fantatsic tasting and in portions. Always feel safe to eat here., I've been glutened at Snooze more than once, and for the last time today, even after discussing Celiac and gluten with the server to make a good meal selection. Sadly, I'll never go back. If you are sensitive to cross-contamination, avoid Snooze. I will from now on., GF pancakes are fantastic! GF french toast is okay.. but i wouldnt wait an hour for it. cross contamination risk is huge .. they are just SO busy. if you are celiac or extremely sensitivr i wouldnt risk it., Fantastic. Food is phenomenal, I have to resist the urge to come every weekend. Be prepared to wait though, this place is ultra popular with gluten and gluten free eaters alike :), Awesome place! They are very careful and cook gluten free food in a desperate pan but they will tell you they cannot guarantee it as they don't have a separate kitchen. The GF pancakes and French toast were good. Would definitely go back., Best gluten free pancakes of MY LIFE! The staff has to sign a confidentiality agreement to not give out the recipe that's how good they are. I thought I was eating gluten!, Sweet was as good as the savory breakfast! Amazing pancakes and French toast! Really impressed., I had a pancake flight it was great! Server was knowledgeable about Celiac. They do clean off the grill to make the food but it is not a dedicated kitchen. Also, while they have gf bread for toast it's put in the sabe toaster as the other bread so I did not eat that! So far no reaction!, I appreciate the GF menu & have never gotten sick here, but for some reason the food here just doesn't taste very good to me. Blah.

It's been one of the dishes that I've missed the most since switching to a GF diet., The Graceland pancake was like heaven. Very helpful staff and super delicious food. Snooze is super popular and very crowded so plan for a Lon wait or get there early. Definitely worth the wait and the price., full GF menu options, fabulous GF pancakes - be sure to add your protein! VERY crowded for a mid-week breakfast at a non-rush hr time, so a locals favorite that is for sure. service was great. will definitely return if I'm in the area, Good amount of food for the price! It was easy to order and identify the gluten free options. I got a classic breakfast plate and a blueberry danish GF and they were both tasty! My family ordered regular gluten-full food and were very pleased!... The vibe is great and they do wonderful with to-go orders as well!, Awesome. Great service very knowledgeable staff, They say that most of the food can be made gf, including eggs Benedict, pancakes, and all the regularly gf breakfast options like bacon and eggs., Let your server know that you have Celiac or a “gluten allergy” and they will inform the kitchen. Have eaten here 4 days in a row and no issues!... Most items on the menu are or can be modified to be Gluten Free.... Great service, cute patio!, This place was amazing. Food was great, reasonably priced, and didn’t get sick. Most of the menu is available gluten free. Excellent breakfast foods.... Thank you to the staff for wearing face masks during covid 19 outbreak. Greatly appreciated., I really love this place! The food is good and I felt very comfortable with the wait staff and how they helped me/handled our order. I can’t wait to go back!... Very decent amount of options. Staff very accommodating to making and changes if needed, We have eaten at Snooze over the years with no problems. However, yesterday we got their take out for the first time (due to social distancing) from the Colorado Bld location. Our daughter is celiac. We ordered online, clearly indicating a gluten ""allergy,"" adding in the comments that she is celiac, etc. We ordered three kinds of gluten free pancakes for our family. Two of them had their ""gluten free"" sticks in them, one did not. She only ate the ones with the sticks in them and was sick two hours later. She was clearly glutened. I wish I didn't have to write this review as we have loved Snooze but I don't want any other celiacs to get sick, especially right now.... It tasted delicious but that doesn't matter because it was not safe for celiacs., I ordered the sweet potato bacon mashup and it was amazing! The staff was very knowledgeable about which items could be made gf and also dairy free. I did not get sick., Yummiest breakfast and pancakes ever for a celiac like me!, Almost any “bread item” (toast, pancakes, waffles) can be made gluten free. My wait person asked if my gf request was due to preference or allergy. The pancakes (King Arthur) are served with gluten free market and are the best I’ve ever had. It’s my favorite gf place!, They don’t have a separate gluten free menu but they can prepare almost anything on the menu gluten free. I’m very sensitive of the last three places I ate out I got sick but I didn’t get sick here so I’m super happy to have one restaurant on my list of safe places to eat! I even asked the waitress to note how sensitive I am to gluten and they took extra time to prepare my meal to limit cross contamination. I had the avocado Benedict it was so good!!, The waiter was very attentive to my gluten free needs and my daughter’s dairy free restrictions. The gf options are huge, like most of the menu can be accomodated - French toast, pancakes, eggs Benedict, etc. So many options that I needed help ordering. I ended up getting half orders of OMG French toast and Habernro Eggs Benedict. Amazingly wonderful! It’s my new favorite breakfast spot! If waiting for a seat is an issue, then try to come at times that are earlier or not a weekend. But worth the wait! Definitely wasn’t “living without” here!, Dropped a star for horrifically slow service; food is excellent, though. Went for Sunday brunch. Pineapple upside down pancake was phenomenal and not as sweet as it sounds, hash browns were a nice treat, too. I liked that you can add a single pancake to any order so you’re not faced with a just-pancakes breakfast., We had breakfast here everyday of our trip. There is a huge selection and almost everything can be made gluten free. It was such a relief to find a restaurant that takes Celiac seriously., Most of their menu can be made GF and it’s really good! Their Chile verde eggs benedict comes on a stack of tortillas instead of an English muffin., Love this chain. No matter which location I have visited, they take gluten free very serious and makes sure no issues. This location had friendly staff and very knowledgeable., My husband and I are regulars here. Only 2 items on the entire menu cannot be made gluten-free. The pancakes are amazing! Never gotten sick here!, This place is absolutely not celiac friendly. They have alot of gf options but every single one of them is cooked on the SAME griddle as the gluten food. I could not eat anything here ( celiac) and my son who has a dairy allergy was also not able to eat here. We sat and watched while the the rest of our party ate. Just another restaurant that doesn't care or understand the needs of people with food allergies., Snooze is fabulous! I enjoyed a delicious omelette. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Felt safe eating here., This is the first pancake in 2 years my daughter liked. Big. Fluffy. Yummy. Great gf options. Highly recommend! We were visiting Dallas and went twice!, Got a great breakfast and didn’t have any issues., Amazing! I’ve never had a cross contamination problem, although “diner” style food is notorious for it. They confirm at the table if it’s an “allergy” or lifestyle. I’ve been here 20+ times. Staff is amazing. Get the “sinful pancake” if you want something ridiculously delicious, but not at all healthy 😂, They have the best gluten free breakfast around! The pancakes and toast are so good! I have eaten here dozens of times and have never gotten sick!, I can’t believe this place exists in Fort Worth. It can be very crowded sometimes, but the food is amazing. I had the two Eggs Benedict plate and split a pancake flight (pineapple, sweet potato, and blueberry). Everything was fresh and tasty, and the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the gf options., So many choices it is hard to decide., We ate breakfast here 3 times in 5 days in San Diego. The options were endless and delicious. My kids were so comfortable with eating there and no reactions. The waitstaff was excellent too., —2019 Review: Worth another Shot—
My friend wanted to try Snooze so I decided it was worth giving them another shot...having Celiac Disease, I was not disappointed this time. For being busy for Sunday brunch, the staff was knowledgeable about gluten free options and ensured me that the kitchen staff goes above-and-beyond to ensure there is no cross-contamination. I had French toast and a chocolate chip pancake. The portions are actually huge so I took leftovers home. It was delicious and I had no issues during this visit to Snooze. ... 
—2018 Review—
Snooze was a disappointment. I was super excited to have brunch as I saw gluten free pancakes and French toast on the menu. My grandfather and I ordered the gluten free pancake of the day. As the waitress is bringing the food to our table, she informs us that the pancake of the day is in fact not gluten free. I’m glad that she caught the mistake before we took a bite as it could have been disastrous. So while the rest of my family ate their pancakes (non-Celiac Disease), my grandfather and I had to wait for new pancakes. We ended up getting blueberry & chocolate-chip. By the time it came out, the rest of my family was done eating though. I wish the waitress knew from the gecko instead of hyping me and my grandfather up and making us wait for a new order. Snooze would greatly benefit by putting labels on their menu instead of relying on the wait staff to tell customers what is and is not gluten free., I eat here often and have never been sick. They seem knowledgeable and accommodating of my celiac., Super yummy! Lots of gluten free options (just ask the waiter). French toast was really tasty! Make sure you put your name in on their app!, Snooze knows how to keep me as safe as possible eating out. It's my go to breakfast/brunch place when traveling. I usually get the snooze classic, with bacon, over easy eggs, and sub out the toast for a gluten free blueberry pancake. I always make sure to ask them to follow allergen protocol and empathize at the beginning and the end of ordering. The pancake comes out marked with an allergen stick in it. I also appreciate that they bring out my order separately from everyone else's, or at the very least, my plate has always been on top. Be prepared for long waits unless you go during the week., The gluten free options are endless! There are only two things on the menu that can not be made gfree. The food was fresh, hot, and delicious. My new favorite breakfast spot., Great friendly staff. Visiting from Texas and quality is always consistent across the board. Definitely recommend this restaurant and also this location. Love how almost anything on menu can be made gluten free and I have never had an issue when coming here., NOT Celiac safe. We didn't make it out of the parking lot before getting sick., They use the term gluten friendly on their menu. There are some GF items I didn’t feel comfortable ordering with celiacs but I’ve had success with their omelettes and hash browns so far. Always crowded on the weekend place with fun retro inspired design., Excellent food, carefully prepared as illustrated by the extra time they took cleaning the kitchen prep area so don’t arrive in a rush, or let them know ahead of time. Numerous choices - they don’t even mark the items on the menu and say everything can be made gluten free, but be prepared for substitutions (GF bread in place of English muffins on the numerous varieties of eggs Benedict). ... Also note the hours: they are strictly a morning place and are close at 2:30pm. ... A very small caveat: their black tea seemed to have a fruit added - unexpected and not our fave, but I’m sure they would have replaced if asked., Stopped in for a quick bite. Ordered two breakfast pot pies unfortunately not offered gluten free, one with fruit and one with hash browns. I was blown away with how amazing the food was. The fruit was so fresh even for it being out of season. Hash browns were great too! Drinks from the bar took longer than our food did. I loved the check being brought with a way to pay at the table, no more giving up our cards to strangers and it made it super fast to pay not having to wait for the card to come back. Would highly recommend this place to anyone. Portions were a great size for breakfast/brunch. ... Was told only 4 items on the menu can’t be made gluten free., When we went to Snooze the waiter was very knowledgeable, I had eggs and gluten free toast, which was very good. I would definitely go there again., Very accommodating of GF/DF needs. Server asked immediately if there were any allergies at the table and gave good suggestions., I’ve been here twice and each time the service and food were excellent. Many options for GF. I’ve had the pancakes and the OMG French toast. It’s a treat to come here., Another great place to eat at while traveling or local to Denver. Hubby & I visited Denver for our Honeymoon and before heading to the Science Museum (awesome experience btw), we decided to grab some breakfast. It was busy and packed out the door but we waited maybe 10-15 mins for a table. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable especially with our allergies. The food was delicious and so light weight on your stomach, Pineapple Pancakes & Spud were the best combos to split. The Drunken Chai was great and the environment was on point. We will def be back!!, Staff knowledgeable. Great options including fun unique gluten free pancakes. Items cons out with gf indicator., We unfortunately had a bad experience due to a mistake. We had informed our server that my partner has coeliac but they forgot to inform the chef of this. An entirely human error but the damage had been done. My partner had eaten almost 2 gluten containing pancakes by the time the server had informed us of the mistake.... I know this place has great reviews and plenty of people have eaten here fine, we were just unlucky. I would add though on the menu they have a disclaimer that they can't guarantee there won't be any cross contamination., Everything is NOT gluten free, why would someone say that?! I've eaten here a few times without getting sick. They offer gluten free pancakes and toast, they take reasonable precautions and do a good job., Told my server I was gluten-free and he knew what that meant. Ordered the Lox 'n Latke Benny. It was delicious., Excellent knowledge of GF and almost everything can be made GF! My fav thing is the Bravocado Toast! Omg amazing! We will be back! I’m celiac and was totally fine, Hands down best GF breakfast place in Charlotte. Almost the entire menu can be GF, and it’s a huge menu! I had the avocado benedict with hash browns and a chocolate chip pancake. Amazing!!!, Yummy place! I got the OMG! French Toast. All of their pancakes or French Toast could be made GF. My kids ordered apple juice and chocolate milk with their meals. The apple juice was so yummy, more like cider. My son said it was like eating an apple. The chocolate milk was thick and chocolatey. Only complaint is that portion sizes were on the smaller side and we all left still feeling a little hungry. Kids plates needed another pancake with it. My plate could have used an egg or side of bacon...something. Definitely would come here again., Had the French toast and sausage links. Pretty good and marked with a tag so it wouldn't get mixed up with anyone else's order. Friendly but slow service., I eat here frequently and I’ve never had an issue. The staff is super understanding and can accommodate everything besides the burrito as GF!","Ami,Valentine,Maximillian,Sarah,Melanie,Abby,Dia Darcey,Cathie ,pattir,Maddie,Laura Buzek,Kathleen Conter,Jaime,Jason,LVM,kstern,Paige,Stephanie,Delisi Friday,Megan,evi gfree,Tup,JK,gfdenver,CindaKay,Angie,Matt,Maureen W,KinzieM,brad,Cassandra,Ashley Ewing Parrott,Angie,Anna,Nina ,CLMAY,Amy,Denise,Martha ,celiacmomfw,Katherine,Julie,Erica Johnson,Samantha,Jewell,Leah,Rachel,Sandy,jillmed,Josh,Lolie M,Alaura,Jordan,Janine,jekel,Peter Myers,Amanda,Gluten Free with ME,Caitlin,Rooraff,Jewell,kim,Suzanne Z,Lydia,devluss,Nina W,Jenna,Katherine Wood,MrsTripleThreat,Katherine,James,Anthony,Tiana,Heather,beccab08,Tricia,ljb in CT,brittany",CO,40,7,59,80206

Did not get sick, Didn't get sick and had great tacos. However, for a place called Margs, their margs were subpar. Would return for the tacos alone., Eaten here several times - always enjoy the huge selection of interesting tacos, and I always feel great after eating here!, A fun place. The first time I went, I explained the celiac issue & they served me with corn tortillas. I did not get sick. However, the next time I went back and tried to order corn tortillas, the waiter said that they would not be safe due to being cooked on the same surface as the flour tortillas, and suggested lettuce wraps instead. Bummer!, Had the tacos a la carte and specifically said that I was Celiac. The waiter was very friendly and said that I could order corn tortillas. They were delicious. I can’t remember which ones I got but they were really tasty. I also ordered the Casa Noble margarita & it was to die for., Great place! The staff was very knowledgeable about gf and asked if anyone has celiacs (which I do). I did not get sick! They no longer have GF chips bc they got rid of their dedicated fryer, but the tacos and margaritas are soooo worth the stop!, Got very sick after eating here., This is a chain restaurant from Colorado. They own the pizza place next door. Their food is primarily made with previously frozen ingredients. Super heavy on the soy and salt., Good food, gf marked right on the menu, friendly knowledgeable staff., We had a very nice lunch here summer of 2016. Our service was great. The waiter was careful to explain how cross-contamination might occur, and even went back and spoke with the chef about what procedures are in place to prevent it. I have looked at the other reviews and agree there is not a large selection available for GF. However, most of the tacos can be had and the tacos, rice and beans were delicious. I have not had a reaction and will go back. They were also very up front about the fact that the kitchen was backed up from an earlier wedding party, which is always appreciated when there might be a wait for your order. ... Made a return visit in August, 2017. Still good street tacos and knowledgeable staff. Chips are not GF-not cooked in dedicated fryer., Great service and food. Special care when taking a celiac's order. Kitchen and staff knowledgeable about cross contamination. Had a great meal and didn't get sick! Excellent happy hour!, Daughter has Celiac disease and they were very careful. Explained their menu and options, also informed the kitchen staff. Owner (I think) even stopped by and checked with kitchen staff for us. Good selection of unique tacos and cocktails. Family friendly with a fun arcade., Yummy drinks. The tacos have some unique flavors but 2 out of the 3 tacos I ordered were really dry., Did not get sick. They take celiacs seriously. Will repeat visit., lots of GF options, however the server mixed up my order and informed me a few bites in... triple check before you take a bite, Awesome! Definitely going back for the guac, Mahi Mahi and veggie tacos!, My guy and I split the 6 tacos option. They were so amazing and super flavorful. Be sure to get the items that have a star next to them, as those are the only gf options. Staff is super knowledgeable., This Mexican restaurant has surprisingly few gf options. It seems more like a tex-mex place than Mexican. the table comes with flour tortillas to nibble on while chips and salsa are $6. Try it yourself and decide but I don't think we're coming back., Upscale Mexican options. GF knowledgeable staff and great margaritas!, The tacos were okay, but portions were small and expensive. Very strong margaritas here., Very delicious Vietnamese taco. Lots of gf choices on the menu., Great tacos. Many GF options.

We don’t have one where I live so I seek it out if I am traveling. Gluten free items are clearly marked and there are several options. When I told the server I had celiac, she said several staff members did too and they could make almost any item gluten free with small adjustments. I got the shrimp tacos which were delicious. I had wanted to try the salmon entree but it had farro. It ended up being what my fiancé wanted so we asked if they could do it gf and she said absolutely. They just swapped out the farro for brown rice. She put the whole ticket in as a gluten allergy and the manager came over with our plates, identified each and noted gluten allergy for each. The server then made sure to confirm the manager had come out and identified. My fiancé’s salmon was also fantastic. I was so happy I was able to have two wonderful dishes with no reaction. And I love the focus on healthy and seasonal food. Because of COVID the menu was a bit smaller than usual but it is great they can still offer so many amazing and safe options., Lots of gluten-free options directly on the menu. However, portions are quite small., Staff was knowledgeable and shared that an employee has celiac. Food was delicious. I had the sweet potato noodle bowl with shrimp and watermelon lemonade., Great place to eat lots of options, First off the food was super delicious and the presentation was beautiful! We had the cauliflower and Brussels spouts appetizer. For dinner we had the Sweet potato noodle ramen as spaghetti squash lasagna. We verified with the waitress that we both had celiac and she showed us where are choices are already marked gf so we would be fine. However this is probably the worst case of being glutened I’ve had in years. Both my partner and I have been sick for the last three days. We had to rush home because we both got violently ill. So if you have celiac or have to be vegan or veggie for allergic reason I highly recommend staying away it’s clearly for the trend., The staff indicated my meal was safe but I have gotten sick after eating here every time. Not with the risk of trying again., Delicious food, and I didn’t get sick!!, So good, a lot of GF options! I had the Inside Out Quinoa Burger and it was so good!, I hate to leave a negative review, but I've eaten here twice now, and I've gotten sick both times. The thing that bothers me about this place is the amount of items on their menu that SHOULD be gluten free, but aren't. (Salmon??) Our server explained that they couldn't be easily changed and retain their flavor. I guess my conclusion is that they just aren't very focused on gluten as an issue in their kitchen., Amazing food! Had the edamame dumplings & steak tacos. And amazing service., I've been here several times, the food is great. The service is usually slow, Very tasty, fresh, seasonal options. Staff is very knowledgeable. Servings are relatively small compared to cost of dishes., Very cool place. Sat at bar and could watch the cooks. All staff we encountered were very friendly. Also helpful and attentive to celiac needs. I had spaghetti squash casserole which was super yummy. My friend had red chili shrimp which she loved., Great spaghetti squash casserole with local chicken sausage!!! And we also had the inside-out quinoa burger.Between the two, my favorite was the squash casserole. Knowledgable staff., I got super insanely sick here. Found out later that they cooked gluten free noodles in the regular pasta water. Manager apologized and promised they'd change their practices but a friend overheard them complaining later that someone with celiac shouldn't be ordering (gluten free?) noodles anyway. Not impressed in the least., Clearly marked gluten free options. No after effects for me. Also, I like their philosophy and food pyramid. Great brunch!, Not my favorite place, but you obviously don't have to worry about gluten cross contamination here. I recommend the bison burger with a GF bun. Great kale salad on the side if you like that!, Awesome is all I can say!!!, Never disappointed when I come here. Great gluten free food and awesome drinks!, Soooooo Good!!, Obsessed with this place! Not only celiac friendly, but they can accomodate to any other needs. So impressed and I always feel great after eating here!, Best restaurant in Denver for healthy/gluten free eating!, Love True Food! They are always cared with gluten free orders. The food is healthy and delicious!, Fantastic gluten free and delicious done so easy great service, Wide selection of both gluten free and dairy free options! Allergens clearly marked on menu. Educated and helpful staff! Will definitely be going back!, I’ve loved everything I’ve eaten here! The one thing I would note is the portions are sometimes a little on the small side- the squash casserole dish being one of them., No guarantees... Nice concept & decor but pizza tested positive with Nima. Others not GF loved their food., They ensure that they speak to their kitchen staff and that they are trained on how to handle allergies.... The food was great and I didn’t have a reaction. The staff was super nice, knowledgeable, and understanding. I’ve been there a couple of times and wouldn’t hesitate to go back, We have eaten here many times and love the healthy food. They seek to accommodate for allergies. I do recommend speaking to manager for significant allergies for added degree of comfort., We ordered a GF menu item for takeout, explained that my daughter has celiac and asked to take precautions against contamination but when we brought home the order Nima tested it as containing gluten. Very disappointing., Knowledgeable staff and they have gluten free items marked on the menu. Even the kids menu has a marked gluten free option (a kids chicken teriyaki bowl). They do have gluten free pizza crusts and buns available as well. Some of our favorites are the Good Earth Kale Cobb Salad and the Steak Tacos. Their menu is on their website and shows all of the GF options so you can look before you go as well. We enjoy eating here., Staff was knowledgeable and there were no issues! Celiac friendly!, Menu is clearly marked, gluten free pizza is great!, Good food in a nice atmosphere. I have ate here several times and have not had a reaction., This is the debatably the best gluten free/vegan restaurant in Vegas. Tons of different options with amazing apps, entrees, and desserts. Highly recommend this place!!!, New in Forum Shopping Plaza on First Level by Joes Stone crab. Great gluten free options including desserts, Staff was very knowledgeable and accommodating. We did takeout and they made sure to put Allergy on the entire order. Food was great and my boyfriend was so happy to have gluten free pizza!, Incredibly friendly and knowledgeable staff! I felt like I finally found a restaurant that understands my eating restrictions, and doesn’t give me the side eye because I’m “being picky”. Highly recommend!, Very clear menu! Got the pizza on a gluten free crust and it was delicious!, Keto options and everything options!!!!, Good health conscious cuisine. Everything is marked on menu and they take allergies seriously. (They have a very good gluten free lasagna!), Staff is very knowledgable. You have to clarify that you are a celiac. Options are somewhat limited if you’ve other restrictions; but, I’ve yet to have a problem because of gluten (yes, I can tell the difference between gluten and my allergies)., Excellent food. Celiac friendly- menu identifies GF items and chef will adjust others., We’ve eaten here many times. My wife is very allergic to gluten and a variety of other things, resulting in migraines and stomach pain if she’s exposed. True Food and Epik Burger are the only two places she’s NEVER had an allergic reaction. That level of consistency is rare in the restaurant industry! And the food tastes great!, Brought my celiac daughter (12) here to eat last night for the first time. She is highly sensitive to cc. We informed the waiter she had celiac and he knew exactly what to do. We shared a flatbread on gf crust that was brought to our table and announced as gf with a gluten allergy. We normally avoid all gf pizzas due to cc in toppings. No problem here and it was delicious. Also shared the fish tacos and beef tacos. Shared 2 desserts - the flourless chocolate cake and the squash pie - all 4 desserts on the menu were gf. Meal was delicious. My husband got a salad with farro in it and the waiter reminded us if the farro when he brought it to the table and said it was not safe for my daughter. Staff knowledgeable, and 24 hours later no reaction., Louis was our server and he was very knowledgeable about the menu and engaging to talk to about different options. He let us know they strive for an overall anti-inflammatory menu in addition to gluten-free options and responsibly sourced meat additions. The gluten free chocolate cake is TO DIE FOR and it was completely guilt-free since I didn’t actually feel like dying after eating here! Love this place and the atmosphere :), I’ve eaten here a handful of times since my celiac diagnosis and all my experiences have been great! Knowledgeable staff, great gf options and very accommodating. A manager always brings out my food to reassure me that it is gf. Even pizzas and flatbreads can be made on gf bread., Delicious food and celiac friendly., Delicious. Good balance of veggies meat and starch. Price is about $20 a plate for lunch but cheaper if you’re a vegetarian. Bowls, pizza, entrees. The burgers are not gluten free except for one. We all had bowls. My first teriyaki bowl! I’ve had gluten free soy sauce lots of places but this was my first teriyaki. Yum, Have eaten here probably 5 times since moving into the Vertis a couple of weeks ago. Have not gotten sick once, the servers have all been VERY knowledgeable! The food is beyond good. It’s my go to place!, 1st visit to KOP True Food Kitchen but have always had great experience at other TFK’s in Scottsdale and Fairfax. Only thing missing on the their menu was a Bison option to add to entrees. I had the GF fish(Bass) tacos. Update 1/4/20 another fantastic meal this time started with beet and cheese flat bread and followed with Spicy Panang Curry added tofu see photo A++!, Staff was knowledgeable about their gluten free options. Had quite a few options to choose from. They were out of their cauliflower polenta, so I had steak tacos. Pretty spicy, but very tasty! I’d go back for sure., Great place! Does not have gluten free designated kitchen but lots of gf options. Korean noodle bowl was great, Family meal out! They were sensitive to our needs and the GF pancakes were amazing!!, Such good food!!! Great with gluten free, Excellent!! Wonderful food and service. You have to try the lasagna. Highly recommended!!, Gluten free dishes were marked on their menu. A little pricey for the portions, but it was all fresh and I felt great after., Came for brunch and was blown away by the number of GF, DF, and vegan options. Staff were kind and knowledgeable. The butternut squash soup was particularly delicious. GF DF pizza also good. Didn’t get sick either! Will definitely return!, Staff were very friendly, lots of GF options on the menu (went for Sunday AM brunch). They noted a gluten allergy when they served each of my dishes...which felt odd at first but was reassuring that the message really made it from the server to the chefs to the food runner.
I’m newly diagnosed so I may not notice if I “get glutened” but I look forward to returning here., Gave them four stars because they had to remake my gluten free, butternut squash w/ vegan almond ricotta cheese pizza. (First order came with carmelized onions which I had asked to omit). Very tasty pizza. Slow service., Excellent food!! Many GF and DF options or can be made to be so. GF buns are great!! Also have grass fed burgers and grass fed steak to add to salads or bowls. Looking forward to coming back., Visiting Dallas and grab dinner here. Better than the one in KCMO this place offers so many options. I had the butternut squash soup and gf pizza., The food tasted good and there were a variety of options., Great GF choices. My son had the GF pizza. He loves it., Really yummy food and drinks! Would recommend! Feel safe eating here!, One of my favorite places forever. soooo many good options. it’s hard for me as a gf vegetarian to find places like this!, Celiac: So many options and the food was So yummy., Staff was well informed and food was excellent. Warning: not all of their refreshers are gluten free but staff was able to tell me mine was safe. Had the Korean noodle bowl with shrimp and it was great, no reaction., I alerted staff prior to our special occasion visit. Had the vegetable crudite and cauliflower appetizers. For entree I had the seabass. It was heavenly. Didnt get sick. What a gem!!, Before celiac, I thought this place was very safe for those with celiac disease. After my diagnosis, it was the first place I went out to eat. I had a burger wrapped in lettuce with avocado. I had a side of kale salad with nothing on it and champagne vinaigrette. I was terribly sick within 30 minutes. They bake here in an open kitchen. I would stay away if you have celiac disease.","Melissa,zduck33,jillian,Cathie ,Tim Kline,Kelsey,Kaley,Emily,Josh Pool,Darlene ,Jackie,Alyx,Carla,Susan ,Nikole,Ben,Alex,Melissa,Pete,Zac,Susannah,Karen,Mackenzie,Steven,Ashlyn,Bonnie,Min,Nora,adb,Strictly GF,Kay,Dana,chmie029,Cynthia,Steven,CAS,Gunnar,Peter,jessica popik,April,nicole,Lisa ,Brittney,Silva ,Andrea,A E,Wendy,ele,Ashley,Fojan,merriless,Chip,Philly_Jasper,sjgrams,lisa rapp,AshC,Cheri,Loretts,Anna,Suzen,Pamela,Sue H,chris m,Kay,JKe,peggy,Laura,Michelle,Sunshine,kim,Shannon,skigal",CO,42,4,58,80206

Am celiac and did not get sick., The food selection is truly a modern culinary fare and the GF options are available for almost all items.... from Pizza to my new favorite the “Homestyle Bowl”.... I will be back!!!, We had a delicious pizza at this location, they seemed well aware of cross-contamination., A lot of reviews are saying it isn’t safe if you get pizza or sandwiches. I got the salmon curry bowl and explicitly told them it was a gluten allergy. It was yummy, fast, and I didn’t get sick. Order smart, communicate, and you should be fine!, I think the salads are probably safe, but I ate a gf pizza here yesterday and it made me really sick. Definitely cross-contaminated, so if you're going to eat here, avoid the pizza., Delicious sandwiches on gluten-free bread that tastes like normal bread!, Modmarket is decidedly not celiac friendly, as the cross-contamination is sky-high. I sent back/refused to eat a sandwich that the guy handled, without gloves, after he prepared a regular sandwich., This place is Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, Delicious. I have never been contaminated here., Getting take out food, especially breakfast food, is hard for celiacs. This place is reliable and fast., Menu is well labeled. The person taking my order did not indicate the pizza should have been GF. I had eaten here before and knew enough to know it looked different. When I asked, the guy said it wasn't and remade it. He let me give the non-GF pizza to my friend., Loved this place. I let them know I have celiac. They suggested the safest options. I ate without incident and am very grateful for their help. I highly recommend to fellow celiacs., I would give this place no stars if I could. Not celiac friendly. I even tried to ask for my money back after being sick for 4 days after eating there and was denied that. Terrible management/customer service., Flat iron salad with no issues. I'll be back!, Great healthy GF food. Highly recommend. Busy and loud. The receipt is particularly great as it gives nutritional break down, This a great place. Most things on the menu are gluten free. The menu is clearly marked. All naturally sourced ingredients. A true gem.. I am the only one in my family who is admittedly allergic to gluten, and we all could eat here and they loved it as well. If you need a delicious gluten free meal in downtown Denver this is the place., Menu is marked with gf designations where appropriate. I had the flank steak plate with rosemary mashed potatoes and balsamic glazed carrots. It was one of my favorite meals of this trip, reasonably priced and I had no reaction. (Celiac disease), Our celiac son's gluten free meal tested positive for guten with our Elisa gluten test kit. The rest of our meals were very good. Manager of course refunded his meal and did feel very bad. I think too many hands moving around in kitchen area. His garlic mash potatoes had bit of my other son's sweet mash potato on the edge-obvious cross contamination. Since test takes about 10-15 minutes, celiac son unable to eat and left hungry and very sad. Learned our lesson, rest of our trip we tested his meal first before ordering any other meals., Had a chicken sandwich on the gluten free wrap and it was delicious! Just visiting the area but would go back again for sure!, Lots of gf options. The cashier was very helpful and looked up the ingredient list for items I had questions about. I got the steak plate with mashed sweet potatoes, and the portions were huge! Definitely felt like I got my money's worth. My non-gf husband really liked his pizza too. Highly recommend as a good fast casual option., This is seriously one of my new favorite places. The food is amazing and very filling and they have a wide selection of gluten free dishes. I am not sure if they are celiac friendly, as I only have a gluten sensitivity, but I am positive they would accommodate., Love this place!! Great options! Pizza but no sandwiches plus salads and plates. Surprisingly good food - a lunch place with better than dinner food! Had pizza one day - very thin crisp crust and fresh flavorful toppings. Much better than the average GF pizza. Salad the other day I went and it had caramelized onions and potatoes on it! Loved it! One of the best salads I've ever had! Certainly seemed to take GF seriously. Have it marked right on the menu and put allergy on my slip! I didn't get sick either time (I'm celiac but not super sensitive). Highly recommend - definitely one of my new favorite spots!!, Yum! So many options and everything that's gluten free is clearly marked on the menu. They have gfree wraps, pizza, soups, salads and breakfast foods., Really flavorful and delicious fast-casual food! Their focus is on fresh, unprocessed ingredients. Half portions of brick oven pizzas (gf) and salads can be ordered for individual portion. Sandwiches can be made on gluten free bread, too. Most items on the menu are gf or can be made gf. They also serve breakfast (I did not have). Nutritional details come printed on your receipt. I love this place!, I was a little unsure about safety but the staff reassured me. When I ordered I told them I can’t have any gluten and that I need the space cleaned and gloves changed. She put gluten allergy with my order so everyone on the assembly chain cleaned the space and changed gloves.... I got the tofu bowl with double vegetables and all I got to say is that sesame tofu sauce is above excellent and I can actually eat it! I actually bought a small container of it to take home because it is so freaking good. I love this place because my whole family can eat here and everyone gets food they enjoy., Have never been sick and I eat here regularly.... Small portions for the price but everything is always delicious., This place is great! Pretty casual, I'd compare it to a Panera Bread because you order at the counter and has a cozy vibe; but much better! I had a BLT-A on gluten free bread. It was really good! I want to go back and try their pizza. My husband had one of their grain bowls and really liked it., Pretty good selection of gf dishes they can prepare and decent service. I usually get the salmon bowl with curry., Everything was a little weird but I ended up not getting sick so I’m ok with it. ... I asked what if the GF items was celiac safe and they didn’t know there was a difference. Ok.... so I ordered conservatively (egg hard boiled and just a salad bowl) and was fine. Fountain drinks were questionable but I had a lemonade and was ok! ... Would go back here if I was in the area again., If I could give this place 6 stars I would. There were lots of options for all sorts of dietary restrictions. I ate the salmon curry and it was amazing. I usually am just glad when things are GF, but the real win is how fresh and amazing everything is., I love their gf pizza, bowls, and sandwiches. I've eaten here several times, but I did get sick once from eating a pizza that was cross contaminated., Amazing food. Great GF Menu. More than 1/2 the items are available Gluten Free. ... 
Unique fresh options. ... 
My favorite is the gluten free corn and bacon pizza. I would never have thought of this combination. It is amazing!, Solid gluten free restaurant. Eaten many times with no issues, Great gf options. I’ve never had a problem and eat here often. There is cross contamination with their pizza due to same pizza oven., I have eaten here many times without any issues. They have plenty of great options as well, I looked at reviews on this chain and decided to give it shot despite having some unsavory reviews about cross contamination. Should have listened. I got a salad and as I was finishing up I found part of a crouton in my salad. Thankfully I didn't have a reaction but I will never eat there again., So good, well marked gf menu, changed gloves, super fresh!! I had the super food salad!! B concourse next to chick-fil-a, Great options for Celiac. Our family will return!
Updated to add both my boys became sick after eating there last night. I told staff there was a wheat allergy and they had the gluten free pizza., Never had a problem at this Mod Market. I always order one of the hand carved plates (usually salmon with veggies). Very easy to customize and vegan are on the menu labeled clearly. I still always tell them I have celiac and I haven’t had a problem. Yum!, Read the reviews but was starving prior to a 5Am departure. Had the bacon breakfast sandwich on the GF bun.... took a few bites.. waited about 20 minutes and felt fine. Ate the rest without a problem. They did have GF items Clearly marked including steel cut oatmeal offerings that sounded good too. I would definitely feel comfortable eating here again., Great options for gf and had no cross contamination issues! Delicious chicken, Love this place! Their sandwiches are so good and everything tastes really fresh., Overpriced sandwiches with almost nothing in them., I've eaten here a number of times without any problems. They have gluten-free bread. I like the avocado toast., Many GF choices. Good food. My fave is salmon plate with salad sides, I got in line and asked the cashier if they were able to accommodate gluten allergies. “We have gluten free bread.” I then asked if I got a salad if the meat would be able to be prepared on a separate part on the grill. “We have gluten free bread.” Guessing that’s a no for celiac-friendly employees and food!, I enjoyed my salad, food was tasty, So yummy! Basically everything on their menu could be gluten free. Definitely celiac friendly., Good set of choices, friendly and accommodating staff. Good lunch., Food wasn’t so good. My steak was very well done and bland., Don’t think twice. They made a perfect GF sandwich., Much of their menu is gluten free. Knowledgeable staff., Thai coconut curry chicken salad is amazing, Many of their menu items (salads, grain bowls, soups) are already gluten free, but sandwiches and pizzas can be ordered GF for an upcharge ($1.75 extra for my daughter's sandwich). The side of chips are not GF, but they offer 3 cookie flavors that all are. My husband and daughter thought the GF bread on her sandwich was very good, and both kids (one celiac, one not) liked the GF cookies. Great selection overall. Note: this location has only been open a short time and the staff had to check when we inquired about the GF chips. The menu is clearly labeled., I’ve had the Thai chicken salad twice and tested in my sensor. Each time the sensor shows no gluten and I felt fine. Plus it’s a really good salad., Had the Thai Coconut salad which is labeled gf. Tested ok on sensor and I felt ok after eating., I stopped by and asked the staff about gluten-free options. They didn’t know anything other than that they had gluten-free bread and they did tell me everything was prepared in the same location. I wouldn’t chance it., Awesome food and most of their menu can be made gluten free. Knowledgeable staff. They were happy to change their gloves. Gluten free bread is tasty. This is a chain, and they have other locations nearby., Lots of options for GF! Ordered the BBQ chicken pizza on GF crust, they put it on aluminum to prevent cross contamination, then had their own pizza slicer to prevent issues. Great food, scarfed it down., Had eaten from the 16th st mall location last year without issue but I definitely got sick from cross contamination at this location. Service was rude on top of that., It is so hard to find gluten free food in an airport. The food was great and offered a variety of gluten free sandwiches and pizza!, They can do both gluten and dairy free. The pizza is on point. Love this place., I got the basil chicken sandwich at the Denver Airport. I had to pay extra for the gluten free bread but it tasted so good and fresh. The bread wasn’t dense and spongey like most. My husband who can eat gluten also liked my bread and he hates most gf stuff., Delicious and lots of GF options! I got the Superfood Salad, fresh brewed iced tea and a gluten free chocolate chip cookie., Great choice in Denver Airport Terminal B, Great options, so many to choose from. Food is healthy but tasty. Definitely a new favorite chain, Went once during lunch and had no issues and an awesome bahn mi sandwich. Went back the following week and unfortunately got sick. Very dependent on who is working in the kitchen., Poor selection of gf items. Mostly take out the bread. We didn't stick around to eat. Out of the three of us who, two gf, none of us found anything on the menu to make us want to stay. Can't offer on how the food tastes. Only that the prices were high for such a common menu. Definitely kitsch, Ordered mashed potatoes. When it arrived, it had a piece of macaroni mixed in. Luckily, I saw it before taking a bite. Was scared to finish my food. I asked at the front counter and they said the macaroni was right next to the mashed potatoes on the serving line., Ordered a salad on a layover. Vomited on the plane. Yes gluten free options but maybe not safe for celiacs., Very good. Enjoyed my meal! Lots of options and the menu clearly labels gluten free, dairy free, nuts, etc., I ate there with no problems but the staff did not seem very knowledgeable. They do have great gf pizza and gf cookies., We ate here twice in one day when we were vacationing in the area! So nice to have healthy choices! Our first cashier, Kaneesha, was friendly and extremely helpful. We felt very confident after talking to her. Our second cashier was the exact opposite and didn't even seem know what the words ""gluten free"" meant. So don't let your guard down here! The Margherita pizza was soft and delicious. But the upcharge for a whole pizza was $3.50. Also, GF sandwiches can't be ordered in the half portion for some made up reason to do with the bread. Despite the unfair upcharges and questionable service, we recommend ModMarket, especially if you're looking for healthy choices., I eat here for dinner often and I’m very sensitive. Food is great and i haven’t had a problem!","User,Shawn,Nyrene ,Rachel,erika,Noah Pindak,Ari,Ansel,Sharon,Joe Maffei,Kim,gfandrea,Tanya,Shannon,Eli,Mtsun,arude,B Kot,Nicole,Lauren,Nicole,Gayle,Beth,Christina G.,Kian,Ami,Katie,FRED,sillyyak,Heather,Amanda,Linda,Renee,Lezlea,asrith tiguri,Emmie Lou,Tiffany,Angela,Jessica P,mumsyto4,Elissa,Maria,Amanda,L.

It’s now the next day. I’m quite annoyed that Boulder ppl post in here claiming they’re celiac when many are not., Absolutely fabulous service!!!! The chef came to our table to discuss our Celiac kids needs. Food was great! There is a shared fryer, so fries and nachos are out, but they have gf buns for burgers and pizza.

There's a good amount of options to choose from and the chips are truly gf, which is great! However, the food isn't the best.

Got the chicken enchiladas and they were good too, Kitchen now uses rice flour for breading. Does still have flour tortillas. Relleno was out of this world., The staff was very knowledgeable. The table chips are celiac friendly. I ordered the nachos with chicken, and also the smoked chicken enchiladas with classic enchilada sauce. The food was excellent!, Delicious! They even use gluten free flour for their chili relleno and fish tacos., Typical line kitchen with lots of flour in it and low incentive to prevent cross contamination. I'm sure it's fine for the standard GF crowd but not appropriate for celiacs., Very knowledgeable! Great food! Separate fryer for warm GF chips and salsa!, Very knowledgeable! Great food! GF chips and corn shells., Chips are gluten free! If you're Celiac and order something like enchiladas make sure you tell your server you want the gluten free corn tortillas.

Enchiladas and nachos are fantastic as well as the house margarita!!, I got very sick from eating here.

Not a good choice if you are sensitive to gluten., food just wasn't very good. not an ""authentic"" Mexican food flavor. nothing I couldn't make in my own microwave. the one plus: no issues with cross contamination, No a fan.

They (boulder & denver locations) have always been great dealing with all my food allergies and vegan diet. Best margaritas too!, Food made me sick....they say they can make almost anything gluten free, I knew better and it made me sick...My dad enjoyed the food but he is not celiac., No gluten free menu and chance of cross-contamination so not a place for celiacs. I am gluten sensitive. The food and service were excellent. The waiter was helpful in suggestions for me from the menu., Amazing! The chicken fajitas (without tortillas) are yummy and i haven't been glutened by them. I have skipped the chips as i think they are fried I in the same oil as the sopapillas., I usually get the huevos rancheros. They are pretty good. Margs are potent! Which may be a good thing if you're looking for value. Taste is not all that good., Easy to order and good food, I've loved their margaritas here for a lOng time, but I ate here last night and I absolutely had a reaction to gluten after ordering gluten free! I ordered off the gf menu and asked my waiter if my meal was gluten free. I am positive My meal was contaminated here! There are so many Park Meadows restaurants that have gf menus and take much more care about. It. Don't bother eating here...it's not that great anyway!, This place has a gluten free menu. We made it clear we needed the corn tortillas and a gluten free meal but the dish came with flour tortillas. I didn't notice until my celiac son had already eaten half of one. Just because there's a gf menu doesn't mean we don't have to still be diligent!, Ok GF menu. I got really sick once so I think cross contamination is an issue for them. The other 2 times were ok, but got REALLY sick the one time.","Laura,Kelly,Maddie ,Ben,Jennifer,Tosha,debt,Michelle,Kathryn,Mike,Kayla,Lisa,Thresa,Renee,J,Susan from Colorado,Malissa,Geoff,Chantal,Marissa ,Allison,Annie G,Sheri,Penny,Jessi ,gf-snowman,Tracy,John,Tim Kline,Crystal,Cindy,Jess,Amy,Erin Van Buren ,Zac,Alec,Molli,User,Amanda,PW,Melissa,TBP,KaitlynM,Kerry,User,User",CO,20,8,33,80302

Slight risk for Celiacs due to the kitchen not being dedicated GF, and the staff is careful to set expectations appropriately as they can’t guarantee against cross contamination, but it’s worth the slight risk in my opinion as the tacos are some of the best I’ve had anywhere. I am celiac, have eaten here dozens of times along with my celiac family members and none of us have ever been sick., Not Gluten Free. Ate there multiple times and had reactions., All tacos gluten free and everything fried separately. Had the classic taco and fish taco and chips and salsa. Did not get sick. Super good and fast., Tacos are good. Chips are fried separately. However they cook the protein from the tacos on the same grill as flour quesadillas., This place is wonderful!! Delicious tacos, dedicated gluten free fryer, fantastic margaritas, would definitely recommend. I have celiacs and didn't get sick after having two tacos (one cotija, one avo & cabbage) and a load of chips, guac, and salsa., Love this place! Went on a busy Friday night...popular spot. Delicious authentic tacos...the shrimp taco was my favorite! Chips are fried in a dedicated fryer...which is awesome. They make everything in house, even grind the corn fresh each morning. Margaritas were top notch. Owner came to the table to explain gluten free options (which is basically everything on the menu). I have celiac and did not react...excited to add another Boulder restaurant to my safe list!, Tacos are great. The server said the chips were gf and after I had eaten a few he came back and said actually the frier was also used to cook gluten containing ingredients. So I got sick! But thank goodness I had only had a few chips. The server felt really bad and it was an honest mistake. The chips are NOT gluten free. Don't eat them!, Great place for quick food. Tacos are tasty and only 2.00 each. 3 will stuff you. I love this place, nice people., Thought the tacos were fantastic! Many options for GF, only one thing on the menu that is not GF. I loved the snapper ceviche as well. I would recommend this place for sure, positive - almost everything on menu was gluten free... negative - wish I would've read yelp reviews. food was good but way overpriced for what we got. each taco was $3.50-4.00 each a la carte. tacos were tasty but tiny. salsa, guacamole and chips are good but nothing spectacular. have to pay extra for chips. service was so so. won't go back, rather eat at Chipotle., I wish they had more vegetarian options but the cheese ones are great., Great tacos, salads, and app with fresh made corn tortillas. Only one thing on the menu has gluten and they are even great for celiacs.","drasbid,Mike,Steve,Krissa,Katie,Alexa,Jules,Sara,Hilary,RC,kempdoc,ecs,fleurmegs,Whitney",CO,6,2,10,80302

I didn’t get sick! I got the chicken and waffles and it was 10/10 amazing. My husband got the BBQ bowl and it was horrible. Whatever you do don’t order any Mac n cheese dishes. Their cheese sauce is so bad!, Brunch was great... Good GF options... Service team very nice... Sitting at the bar as one person got me around the cue, Guys. Beware of this place. I have known people who worked in the kitchen. Aside from it being far from clean... they do not take any precautions to avoid cross contamination. Anything prepared in that kitchen is gonna come out glutened. The bakery next door that they get their ‘GF’ baked goods from has the same issues. Just because you don’t get sick doesn’t mean you didn’t get exposed. ... Subpar food, slow, rude service- and I’ve been glutened here twice., Very delicious soup, cauliflower/shishito pepper appetizer, and gluten free noodles!, Easy to follow labeled menus and specials. knowledgeable wait staff. Numerous GF options. Vegan restaurant, no meat menu, but still hearty. Full bar. Wait 20-30 minutes during busy lunch. GF desserts., Sick here multiple times off of their “gluten free” waffle and pizza, Had the GF fries so good ketchup was safe too., The staff were friendly and helpful, but the food wasn’t very good. I had a GF margarita pizza and the crust was not great. I wouldn’t go here for their pizza. I’ve been to other places with crust a 1000 times better., Yummy gluten free waffle! Cute place, great service!, The food is delicious and the kitchen will accommodate celiac guests-- just expect a little extra wait. I had a pumpkin pasta and it was amazing. Do beware of anything in the fryer. They label some things as GF that go in a shared fryer. I am pretty sensitive and ate here with zero problems. My recommendation, inform your server before you order., If you have celiac, you will get sick if you eat here. All of the food is prepared in the same place, and the fryer is shared. The menu is very limited for GF options, the waffles are rock hard and starchy. Overall not great., Large variety of vegan and gluten free options. I had the Sonoma Bourbon Cider (GF) as wells as their spaghetti meatlessballs & baguette (vegan & GF) it was might tasty. Went on a Monday night around830-9pm, it was packed with an average 25 minute wait. Staff was nice & knowledgeable of menu., I had dinner here with no problem it was delicious! Shared the tacos and the noodle salad and the sticky rice , all amazing! Great drinks too., Tons of ""gluten free"" options. However, when I informed the server I'm actually celiac, just to make sure, she said the ONLY safe thing on the menu was the GF waffle, due to there being a separate GF waffle iron. Forget about anything else that touches a grill, griddle or fryer. Five stars for great savory waffle and the server knowing enough to warn me; zero stars for misleadingly calling everything GF., DO NOT COME HERE FOR DINNER!! The food lacks in flavor and like the other reviews we found the same thing. HOWEVER, the dessert is awesome here. They have gf ho hos and a Samoa Girl Scout cookie and wonderfully baked desserts. We usually go and get kombucha on tap and dessert. It's delight to have dessert here. It's worth the money. And I'm sensitive but have never gotten sick, We swing by this place for desserts after a day at the zoo. Several GF options., Really disappointed in the cross contamination issues. SO many things are listed as GF and then I am informed they are fried communally with gluten. ... Even all of their potatoes. My precious potatoes! I wasn't impressed, and the service was slow and snooty. Real bummer., TERRIBLE gluten free waffle. Tasted SO strongly of vinegar. Nothing good about the texture or the taste. Amazed they don't have more complaints about it. Upset I wasted my time (the service was terrible!) and money :(, Lots of GF options, we went for breakfast. It's vegetarian, potatoes were great., This is my favorite place to grab a gluten free bite. The pizza crust is thin and crisp, just how a NYorker would like it. Honestly, its the best gluten free crust I've ever had. Bravo. And I've NEVER had a cross contamination problem here. Keep up the great work!, So many options! The waffles are awesome, the pizza crust is some of the best that I've had, and the cookies make an excellent dessert., very good gf menu. I had a tofu bbq sandwich on gf bread with kombucha from the tap. very tasty., The only gf options are salad, soup and sides. No sandwiches, or main courses. They don't even offer gf pizza., There are so many options for gluten free.

I understand that not every restaurant is able/willing to avoid cross-contanimation, but it was far too difficult to get a direct answer., Didn't realize all the great ratings are old. We were visiting for the Gluten-free festival and were absolutely willing to pay a $4.00 upcharge per sandwich if my celiac partner could have a real Italian sandwich for the first time in almost 5 years. We got the ""we can't guarantee"" line that every place gives, but when we asked about cross contamination precautions we got an ""I can change my gloves."" We were going to risk it, (again, good reviews here) and asked that they bag his two gluten free sandwiches separately from my regular bread sandwich. A few minutes of watching and we were less and less confident. I asked if we could talk to the person preparing the sandwichs and were told he would come to our table in a minute. Someone ELSE came and talked to us and said they don't usually but could put down paper, clean the knife, change gloves, etc. Before he was done talking with us, however, they brought out all thee sandwiches in one bag. At this point we both agreed there was too much risk. He offered us a refund, but while the cashier was trying to figure out how to process it (poor girl said it was her first day) the actual sandwich maker started yelling that they were NOT refunding the whole order. I told him there was no way my partner was going to risk being sick for two weeks and have permanent damage. The cashier did refund the credit card charge in cash (the purchase price but not the $4.96 tip) from the register. ...

I will definitely be returning!, Both my boyfriend and I visited here on a whim. He's is Celiac and I'm supportive.

The Udis bread they use isn’t fantastic, but it’s sure nice to be able to Hager a regular sub. I think it’s a $2 up charge for gluten free. They change gloves and seem to be careful., I’ve eaten here 3 times and the last 2 times I got sick, I will not be going back. Cross-contamination is a big issue here., Separate workstation to build sandwich, with separate utensils. Allergy protocol there is taken seriously by staff.
I’ve had subs from there several times and have never felt sick.
Good bread too!, Asked if it was gluten allergy or preference and took precautions including changing gloves and preparing in separate, cleaned space., Great gf options. They clean the grill and change gloves., Order here regularly. I let them know up front and they do a good job wiping down to make sandwiches. Glad to find a place I can have a quick sub sandwich, Staff is great! Eaten from here multiple times without any issues. I’ve seen them put together my sandwich and they’re very careful not to contaminate anything., They offer gluten free bread in all sizes. They ask if it’s allergy or preference when you order gf bread. If it’s allergy they automatically change gloves or ask if you’d prefer it. They take some precautions to ensure the space they use and the knife they cut with is clean. Because their sauces come from a squeeze bottle and are not spread on, there’s little chance for cross contamination from the ingredients., Offer GF sub rolls for all sandwiches. When I mentioned a gluten allergy, they cleaned the slicer, used new utensils, put the sandwich on paper, and put on new gloves. Very knowledgeable about cross contamination. One suggestion - ask them to heat the GF bread before making your sandwich., I always love jersey mikes cause they do the gf prep in front of you, and they clean and take it seriously, I watch them open the bread from a separate area, and put it on a mini cutting board! The prep is great, and I never have stomach aches. I think it’s a great place for lunch!, Love Jersey Mike's. The staff is trained so well, they clean the slicer and surfaces, separate utensils, change gloves etc. The food is always fresh and tastes great. I've had both hot and cold subs and I've never had an issue and I'm a super sensitive Celiac., We like that they offer GF bread now, just wish there was a kids menu option too., Udi bread is used. Changed gloves and staff new difference between gluten free and gluten free for an allergy., Excellent service. This location is new and well gladly do special and gluten free orders. Beware the "" juice"" is made of red vinegar and olive oil but the olive oil is half soybean oil. If u have an allergy to soy leave their ""olive oil"" off ur sandwich, Sandwiches have not disappointed. Bread is really tasty and all the various cheesesteaks are our favorite, Unsure... My favorite gf sand which place. Severe celiacs and never had a problem. Delicious!, Negligent and doesn't pay attention to details in notes, I enjoy the turkey & cheese sub when my office orders lunch from Jersey Mikes. It’s nice to be able to order with the group! I’ve never had a reaction., When we told them it was GF they all changed their gloves and wiped everything down, Wow very very impressed. The whole staff knew everything about gluten cross contamination and whelpful in answering questions. They took me very seriously and changed gloves, changed the cutting board, used a dedicated gluten free knife, sliced a new tomato for me, and were in general just very impressive. Did not get sick and am sensitive.... Will definitely be back!... They can do basically any sandwiych GF... Great staff. Will be back!!!, Ordered pickup and my wife grabbed my sandwich. GF bread was good enough, and the sub was excellent!, It's covid so I couldn't stand in there and watch them make it, but I ordered through the app, put a ton of notes asking them to change gloves etc. And I didn't get sick so in my celiac mine they're winners., Horrible service! The staff COMPLETELY lacks knowledge in celiac disease/gluten allergy and cross contamination. When I asked for a gluten free menu the guy points to the bread and says, ""all we have is gluten free bread."" I ask about fresh veggies as I can tell they don't utilize utensils and I was told what they have out is all they have. The guy explained they clean the machine that cuts the meat and they have gluten free bread but that was all. If you have celiac disease or a severe gluten sensitivity I would not eat here, They will clean the grill, change gloves, wipe down counters and keep your sandwich on paper the whole time in case they missed anything when they wiped down.... Everything is freshly made, Imagine paying $4 extra for gf bread. Foh, My husband is celiac and they poisoned him here. It happened only once, but we will not trust Jersey Mike's ever again after this. They do use the same grill as the gluten food and we've seen them clean it before cooking our food, but the guy there that night I guess wasn't trained properly. Shouldn't have to babysit their workers. Do not eat here if celiac... Very poor since not celiac safe, Staff changed their gloves and prepared sandwich on new paper to prevent cross contamination.... Most sandwiches are available gluten free with their special bread.... I would go here again for gluten free., Manager made my sandwich and took care to change his gloves and use a clean tray and knife. They did wipe down the meat slicer to be safe.... Was not able to have the sandwich warmed up because they use the microwave for so many other things.... Restaurant was clean. They are doing the social distancing in the COVID-19 requirements., They were very busy today when we stopped in but they did a great job of making sure everything was celiac safe! Great job thank you!, Separate kitchen space... Great customer service, separate prep area and use of utensils. Very careful. We never get sick and love the cheesesteaks!!!, They did a poor job cleaning off equipment and then used the same mayonnaise and knife as everyone else. We ended up just taking our son to Kroger to pick out something safe rather than let him get sick ☹, Clean the slicer before use, change gloves, wash hands before prepping gf order.... Almost all the subs can be made with the gf bread.... Very informed employees and friendly and eager to help, They clean surfaces, utensils, wash hands and get new gloves, clean slicer etc for all GF orders... I think all subs can be made on GF bread (Udi’s), They offer udis gluten free buns and udis gluten free cookies. I got the gluten free veggie sandwich & I did not get sick. They wash all counter tops and change gloves and clean utensils (have a dedicated gf knife to cut bread) before handling gluten free food... Most sandwiches can be made gluten free, Tested a GF steak and cheese with a Nima gluten sensor and it tested positive for gluten. Not confident in staff’s ability to mitigate cross contamination.... Have had great past experiences but the most reason was contaminated. Try at your own risk, will not be ordering again in the future.... Had great past experiences. Unfortunately the most recent, I ordered a GF steak and cheese and tested it on the Nima gluten sensor. The sub tested positive for gluten. Not confident in the staff’s ability to mitigate cross contamination despite being told it was an allergy., Have been multiple times and they always clean off the surfaces and change their gloves to avoid cross contamination. They are knowledgeable and are always happy to help., They were so accommodating...the girl that helped me went to the back and got the veggies and mayo from the back (so no cross contamination). She also cut the meat and cheese on a separate slicer. They also have gluten free bread. Best sandwich I have had in years!!!, Awesome staff a decent sandwich., Very careful about cross contamination., Informed staff I was celiac, asked about there allergy protocols. Staff told me they can accomodate and have a seperate line for making food. I ordered my sandwich asking for gluten free bun...he relayed the order to someone else. They prepped my sandwich on a back line(I couldnt see) adding toppings from the front line to mine, they had a seperate knife and everything. Got home...was the same bread as my husbands which is not gluten free., Celiac friendly. I have eaten here several times and I've never had a reaction. Just ask for gluten free bread and they will ask if it's by choice or allergy. If you tell them allergy, they take it to the back and prepare it in a separate location., When ordering gluten free they clean the entire area including the slicer. They changed gloves and got all ingredients from the back. They have gluten free bread and keep it completely separate from the regular bread.... Any sandwich can be made gluten free and the gluten free bread is pretty good. They have chips and sometimes individually package gluten free cookies., I am celiac and never had an issue. They use certified gluten free bread (Udis). They ask if you have an allergy and they change out gloves/utensils and make the sandwich in a dedicated gf station., I haven’t eaten in restaurant due to covid so I am not sure what safety precautions they take. I ordered a sandwich on the gluten free bread and though I didn’t get sick I can’t say I really enjoyed my meal. The bread they use is the worse gluten free bread I’ve had. It was super dry and thick but also didn’t hold up at all. Basically from the first bite the whole bread flaked into a million pieces and I had to chug water cause it was so dry. So yes they offer gluten free bread and I assume it’s pretty safe to eat but other than the meats and veggies it’s not very good., One person stayed w the order instead if passing it. Wiped down everything, including the slicer. Alerted rest of staff he was doing gluten free. This has been process each time I’ve eaten here.... Udi’s bread was a bit too much, maybe hollow out a bit before eating. Even had gf cookies and chips were good.... Amazing. Almost any sub can be gf. Bread was softer and they even have Udi’s cookies. They were all very careful about cross contamination., Used to work at a Jersey Mikes before I was diagnosed. There are no dedicated gluten free zones and bread touches almost all the surfaces so I don’t trust it","Erik,kristy,Amber Eichorn,Catie,Megan,Dave,Mardianne,Kelly,Joey,Marc,Christina,GlutenStinks15,Cecilia&Daniel,Nicole,Jackie,kymaaera,Angelica Lopez,Max,Allison,Michele,Jessica,joshmagner,sh1234,TJ,Kristine,Chelsea,Hannah,Cameron ,Lisa,Matt,Lory Breckler,Terry,lucinka,Karan Anne,Howard,Michelle,Rylie,PCapstick,Tyler,Barbra,Anthony,User,Bobbie,Robert,nikki,Darryl,Maria,Ama Burns,Kian,Jaime,Sarah",CO,5,2,37,80203

I had the buffalo tempeh sandwich with a Caesar salad and a side of Mac n cheese. The Mac n cheese is worth skipping. It is good but I honestly didn’t think it was good enough for the calories. The sandwich and Caesar salad was 10/10. If you’re going with somebody who isn’t celiac, my husband had the Big Rig breakfast and he loved it so much he said, “It so good, I could cry.” Highly recommend this place!, The menu denotes gluten free and gluten free optional items, but there is no dedicated fryer for the GF items so you end up with as few options as you might have elsewhere. Even though I often settle on a salad, with minimal risk for cross contamination, I have gotten sick from this place three times now. I’m scared to go back :(, On the menu, they have tons of gluten free options. However, several things I wanted to order (chicken and waffles) have a shared fryer and are not actually gluten free. That was a bit disappointing. but our server was very knowledgeable on what was actually gluten free and what was not. I had the French toast with fruit and it was great!, Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner. Green's Gluten Free beer... Even though they say they have many options for GF they really don’t. Do not have a separate fryer and even says that on their menu. When questioning the waitress she said “Oh it is only if you have celiac’s that you shouldn’t eat that”. I won’t be back., The GF options are very misleading, because everything is prepared in a shared kitchen with shared equipment, so if you have celiac there's very little that's safe. The food is very expensive and the service is terrible., Could use more GF and nightshade free optIons. Nice service., Yesterday was our first dining experience at Watercourse Foods and my gluten-free dinner was amazing. Our waiter was so friendly and knowledgable...just plain fabulous. We were all so impressed by the ambience, the staff, and all the little details that make Watercourse so special. We are already planning our next visit., wonderful pancakes, great cider, Yummy food! Just be sure to let your waiter know you are celiac or very sensitive. Anything fried is not safe for Celiacs as they do not have a dedicated fryer. The scout cookie tastes just like a Girl Scout Samoa cookie! So good!, First time I ate there I did not feel well. Decided to give it a second chance and made sure to tell the waiter about our previous experience and he said he would make sure our food was safe. It was wonderful and neither my sister or I (both Celiacs) got sick. We will eat there again, Great food! Lots of gluten free options with even more chances to make things gluten free! I haven't had a churro since I had to stop eating gluten and their GF churros were amazing!, Yummmm! Great option for GF and vegan!

The downtown location is my favorite for quality, but they all make sure to put gluten free bread on foil before putting through toaster (I'm not sure about their practices aside from that). I'm intolerant to gluten, so I am ok eating here, but I am not sure about safety for those with Celiac's., They have gluten free bread and a gluten free menu posted on their website. There is a high risk of cross contamination, which they disclose on the menu. They usually run out of gluten free bread around 7-8pm, so call ahead and check. I'm leaving a low review because service is terrible at both University City locations., Great gf sandwiches. Picked up over 20 + Sandwiches for a tailgate.

Staff was mildly helpful about gluten free options when asked about a gluten free menu, stating "" we only have gluten free bread."" I did not get sick.

They did not mark which sandwich was gf so it was a bit of a panic when it was delivered. Not sure if it's safe for celiacs cause of cross contamination - I did not ask. We ordered it through Uber eats & some of our food was missing but I dunno if that's the driver or restaurants fault., Gluten free OVEN TOASTED sub sandwiches!!! The bread is amazing and they toast the entire sub after building it to give your bread that extra crunch that we usually miss out on with GF bread. They do ask if you're ordering for dietary reasons or allergy and made sure to change their gloves (thank you for understanding!!). I had the Italian and it came with many toppings that I could add including hot peppers. The price of the sub is a bit daunting at $10 but I can only imagine it's because they get the bread from a speciality bakery since it's in a sub sandwich form and far from a hot dog bun you typically find! I also was only able to eat about half of my sandwich since the portion was huge and the bread was filling so next time I will be splitting it with a friend. While Thundercloud has some decent subs, I would say Snarf's is WAAYY better because the bread is toasted which really holds the sandwich together and gives it an overall delicious taste. Their meats are of higher quality as well and offer more free toppings. There is also a location over by UT but I feel very lucky this location is near by my neighborhood and will be back many times more!, My food was made on the same surface as my friend's sandwhich, and the area wasn't wiped off before making my sandwhich.

Dedicated gluten free menu. Staff was knowledgeable about attentive to celiac. We’ll be back., I get a burger on their gluten free bun with fries without any issues. Good meal., Gluten free buns and fries. Very capable staff and separate menu. Consistent quality, Great burgers and salads. Have eaten here multiple times without any issues. The new GF buns are the best I've had!, Have eaten here several times with no issues. Salads with grilled chicken and burgers with GF bun have been delicious., I brought my Nima sensor tonight and tested my burger. I got the “green and hot” burger and it came back with gluten found. I had told my server prior to ordering that I had a severe gluten allergy (celiac) and he assured me that he would tell the kitchen. After testing my food my server got the manager. The manager was super nice and she made sure that the kitchen took all of the precautions the second time around. I didn’t get sick after, but I am super thankful that I had my Nima sensor or else I would have gotten super sick., Amazing bison burger on a fresh, yummy gf bun. Fries in a dedicated fryer. Server was helpful and knowledgeable. Definitely recommend!, I’ve eaten here 3 times ... unfortunately in addition to gluten I’m also allergic to several other proteins including beef and pork so I get excited for the rare bison steak I eat here off the gf menu. They said they “flagged” all my allergies and I cannot attest to the celiac friendly part (although the first shrimp appetizer came out with the bread underneath and the had to remake it) but I’m almost certain I tasted a piece of bacon stuck to the outside of my bison steak and got pretty sick afterwards. Soooo 2/3 not sick, 1/3 SICK, This was a great find for a family dinner after the RV show in Hartford! They have dedicated fryers here as well as GF rolls. Everything was delicious! I do not have Celiac so I cannot say for sure about cross contamination in the kitchen, but I do appreciate the dedicated fryer. Wait for food a little lengthier than we felt should have been for burgers at 5:00 on a Saturday night when it wasn’t that busy yet. Waitress was not that attentive. But overall experience was good and food was all excellent!, Do not eat here!!! I ordered a steak sweet potatoe and broccoli. I explained to the waiter I could not eat gluten. To make a long story short... I was deathly I'll for 3 days due to there incompetence. I wrote a review on yelp heard nothing back from Ted's. I will never eat there again., They provided a separate gluten free menu and were very accommodating!, Ordered off gf menu, got sick., Been to Teds several times, food is great and never had any reactions!, The staff was very knowledgeable. The only reason I gave it four stars is because fries were not fresh at all. Salmon was delicious, They have really good burgers with gluten free buns. They also have gluten free fries and lots of other choices. My son also has a dairy allergy as well as the gluten allergy. They make his steak without butter and he has never gotten sick after eating at this location., Excellent food. We ate here twice on our trip. The staff understood allergies and hunted down food labels. They also understood cross contamination and how to make things celiac friendly., Good news: The GF menu had a lot of options and my server was knowledgeable and helpful. Bad news: My salad was served with croutons—in the bottom of the dish, so I didn’t see them until I’d eaten a good amount of the salad. The server apologized, removed it from the bill, and offered me another dish, but I would be wary of eating here again. At the very least, I wouldn’t order a salad., (Previous rating was a 5) I had an adverse reaction to my meal yesterday for the first time. I ate here several times without issue, always getting the Skinny Dip and loving every second of it. But don’t think I’ll be back after this last visit. 😞, Amazing. Everything. Best place in Columbus., I was assured that the chips were cooked in a dedicated fryer, but I got sick. All I had was a beef burger on a gf bun. I have no idea what made me sick., Awesome. So many choices and environmentally conscious too!, th ere was m bmmm m. mu m .m ubm. M. m mm

W8www3 mM. M. M. m m m mm m mmu, We have eaten at the Tallahassee location several times and my daughter (with Celiac) has never had an issue., Had dedicated gluten free menu with a lot to chooses from. I got the bison filet with baked potato and asparagus. I am also peanut intolerant so I asked the server about that. She was able to answer right away. Order came fairly quickly and I have to say that for the money, everything was worth every penny. Everything tasted very good and I have to say that the filet was the best I EVER tasted. I’m not used to being able to have a filling meal with 2 sides but I was very impressed! I had absolutely no digestive issues afterwards. I will definitely be back., This restaurant has a varied gluten free menu. Delicious food!, Very careful and great food. Wonderful service. Best pickles since Philippe's in Los Angeles., They have great tasty gluten free buns. They are very sensitive about allergies. I have been several times and never gotten sick!, Last 2 times I got very sick on top of slow service. Tonight after saying I had celiac my meal came out with a regular bun., Overall very good experience! I ordered their beef burger on a gluten free bun with a side of French fries (dedicated GF fryer). The patty was a bit over cooked but that’s my only complaint. Service was good!, They had a dedicated fryer and gluten free buns! The buns were not bad! It's been about 5 hours since my meal and I'm not sick. They change gloves and everything. They seem very aware of cross contamination., Food was amazing and if you sit at the bar you can see the staff cooking the meal right in front of you. I got steak, asparagus, & fries (separate frier). They had a ton of other sides to choose from that are gluten free as well. Unfortunately, there is no gf dessert option other than vanilla ice cream., The experience was good overall. As a newly diagnosed celiac, this is one of three places I have tried to trust. Our server seemed to totally understand the term “celiac” and provided their gluten free menu. The food was delicious, but my body’s reaction was not. I definitely think that somehow I got “glutened”; probably should have asked more questions and been more assertive rather than just trusting the menu and assuming the severity was fully understood. I would recommend that celiacs tread with caution and excessive communication., Staff was knowledgeable. Gf bun and dedicated Fryer for fries. Cheeseburger and fries were delicious!, Always had great service here getting gluten free accommodations. So glad the French fries are now cooked in a dedicated fryer and they now offer a gf bun for their burgers!, They have a separate GF menu. The waiter also said that the kitchen staff changes out their gloves when notified of a gluten allergy and they have a separate fryer if you want French fries!, There is a gluten free menu. I had the bacon cheeseburger with a GF bun, and French fries (there is a dedicated fryer), and felt totally fine afterwards!, I’ve gotten sick from their fries even though they said they were safe. I have also found onion mixed in with my lettuce when I specified I am highly allergic to onion. If you are highly sensitive, I do not recommend eating here., Ted’s had a separate menu and dedicated fryer for their French fries - both I’m a fan of! Anything from a pretty good burger on an Udis roll to a salad., The bar staff was VERY knowledgeable about celiac/ gluten free offerings. Excellent food and exceptional service!, NOT SAFE! My son started to eat his food and we just confirmed it's safe. Server checked and said the kitchen missed the gluten allergy call out on the ticket. Wife ordered the veggie burger and the cook came out to let her know there was panko crumbs in it and said he was confused between vegan and GF?? Manager was very apologetic., GF menu but cheeseburger tested positive for gluten using Nima., Great attention to detail. Good food., Great food, great service, and very knowledgeable and careful!, Love that they have gluten free bread! The service is GREAT and the food is Amazing👍🏻👍🏻, Server was amazing when it came to all the inquiries we had but unfortunately the kitchen didn’t do so well. Taste was fine not celiac friendly regardless of the Gluten Free menu offerings (that are cooked on same cookware and fryers as non-GF food). Got sick even with warnings, will not be a next time for us., I felt reasonably safe, and didn’t feel sick afterwards. However, the service was so awful, it was hard to overlook and therefore made me question the safety of my food while eating. I felt like I wasn’t really being listened to when placing my order, and the server did not seem knowledgeable. Open kitchen, for what it’s worth. I had a bison burger, and the meat was over cooked beyond my request, but still good. However, the generic gluten free bun ($$$$) was cold and crumbled. Would have been better off with a lettuce wrap of the meat or no bun. Extremely slow service, even taking into consideration it was a weekend. Server had our table as well as 5+ others, including a party of 11 people right next to us.","Elizabeth,cyndypilhorn,Tracy,Erin Van Buren ,Sara,Tara,Brynn,Krista ,Frank,Janie,Tisha,Rachel,Rachel,Katie,Erin,tmfife,Kristin,Jared,karin,Jen,jdrugan,[email protected],Gina,Bethany,Wendy,kacey,sara,Barbara ,Chelsea,michaela,Dionne,Paul,Clare,Colleen Philbrook,Maria,Lisa,Caitlin,Jasper,Des,Rachel,Julie,KRobertson12,Beth,allison,alinart,GlutenFreeMom,Monica ,Rodney,Shannon,Thomas,Peach,Owen,Thomas,katerinadsch",CO,25,8,44,80202

Staff was super knowledgeable and said they can also make almost any of the menu items gf. I also had the gf benidict which was delicious., It’s nice that they have so much gluten free food on the menu, but the food and service is pretty mediocre for the price. My sausage was raw in the middle, the gf toast is super dense and wet, the cinnamon roll was drowning in icing which made it overwhelmingly sweet. They were definitely understaffed and kept forgetting to get us more water. Try going on a day that isn’t busy, maybe you’ll have a better experience., Outstanding - worth the wait. Kudos to wait staff, kitchen chefs, tarbenders 😉 yum and all who make it run., They have a ton of GF options which is great and they are very knowledgeable about allergies. Unfortunately the menu only has like two things that can be made dairy free, but we survived the day., I was so disappointed today. My friends and I met here for my bday. We waited 1 1/2hrs for food that never came! They kept apologizing but nothing changed. ... The menu looks great but didn’t get a chance to eat there since my friends didn’t want to wait any longer., I live out of state. I used this app to find a gluten free place. This place is amazing!!! I got the gluten free donuts, cinnamon roll and gluten free pancake. They can make anything on the menu gluten free. Stay very friendly and knowledgeable. I will be stopping back on my way out to town., This place was wonderful. Extremely well-informed and excellent food. Great to go to a place where even non-celiac folks will order GF to keep the whole table easier to manage for the kids. Apparently they usually have a separate waffle iron for GF but it was broken (no biggie, plenty of great stuff), I just appreciated that they were conscientious enough to mention it., This place is great! Best cinnamon roll ever and some great breakfast options. Will come back when I’m Denver., The food was amazing and they take extra precautions if you are celiac (just let them know)., Wow! This place is delicious! The GF pancakes, donuts, cinnamon rolls are sooooo good! I wish we would have found this place sooner. This is a must-go if you are in Denver!, The staff was so knowledgeable and ensured almost anything could be gluten free. Gluten free waffles and chicken were delicious!, Staff was very knowledgeable- they specialize in allergy-safety and can make anything on the menu gluten free. I had the French toast special ( strawberry French toast with Nutella ganache) and it was fantastic!, The staff was incredibly knowledgable about the food as most everything can be made gluten free. It’s not a completely GF kitchen though. I enjoyed the roasted veggie hash and my friends’ like their eggs benny and breakfast tacos as well. Already looking forward to another time., Fantastic food with tons of default gluten free options like churro doughnuts and cinnamon rolls. Everything I've had has been delicious from French toast to skillets., The food is great! And they have great GF churros and pancakes and waffles! Staff is also very helpful., Wow!

The staff is so nice and very knowledgeable of gluten allergies., Great place and great options., We asked if they had a gluten free menu and I heard the sweetest words: ""Everything on the menu can be made gluten free.""

We were thrilled to find such a great stop on our road trip through Denver. Well worth our detour off the freeway., Lots of gluten free options. Nice spin on traditional meals. They don't charge extra for gluten free items, This is a great place for breakfast or lunch.And for a person with Celiac Disease it is safe and loaded with choices.

Wait staff knowledgeable - informed me no dedicated fryers., I ate here because it was the only place in the food court that said they had gluten free options. I was skeptical about how gluten free it’d be by the looks of their kitchen area but they assured me they’d take precautions to avoid cross contamination. Long story short, it wasn’t a bun it was just bread and I still got sick. Guess my gut feeling was right! Don’t recommend it here. Not only is it not safe but it’s really not that great. I would have been better just going hungry., My girlfriend is celiac and we never really get food together at the Braintree's Southshore Mall because I don't want to eat with out her due to every other option being glutened. We looked online real quick to see if Johnny Rockets had gluten free buns. Turns out that they do!... She just got a Cheese burger with fries.
Usually she'll feel the gluten effect right away. Nope she ate it all with no problems.... Took a risk with cross contamination cuz its a mall area but she was fine., They told me it is not a dedicated fryer and the guy did not have a clue what was GF except the GF bun., Nothing gluten-free at this location. I asked if ""do you have gluten-free options?"" and was just told 'No' with no suggestions provided., Went for lunch. Waitress/hostess was very nice. Asked right away is it was for allergy/celiac or for diet purposes, and then explained the menu based on that. No separate fryer, but everything else was great!, They don't have a dedicated space to prepare the gluten free meals. The GF free bred is prepare with the normal bred. The only safe thing was a salad., Not gluten free !!! And staff were rude as I thought since it was on the app they would have something, The fryer is not dedicated. They do have GF buns., They said that their burgers are gf and fries are made in a dedicated frier and they have Udi's gluten free buns. The food was really good! I am not sure how sensitive to gluten I am, so I don't know if it is safe for those who are very sensitive., They offer GF Buns but no longer have a dedicated fryer or claim safe from cross contamination so we left after ordering our drinks...very disappointed, They no longer have a dedicated fryer. Also, waitress said the coating on fries makes that no longer gluten free., Great gluten-free burger buns, they also had some gluten-free shakes., French fries and milkshakes knowledgeable cashiers, This location no longer has a dedicated gluten free fryer for French fries. The manager said corporate changed their policy and they only have one fryer now. Very disappointed as this was one of our “go-to” restaurants for great burgers and fries., From the moment we walked into this place it was a mess. 85% if the restaurant was empty but they couldn’t seat us because they didn’t have enough staff. We were told a new waiter had arrived and we’d be seated soon, but it still took another 10 minutes and the host was visibly embarrassed. Waited a total of 20
minutes and (and this took place at 11:45). I have no confidence in this place even though I didn’t get sick. I did get a GF bun, fries were cold, and at the end of the meal, I noticed mold on a piece of uneaten normal bun on my kid’s plate. They didn’t discount the meal for it, either. I had never been to Cedar Point and was hopeful the food would be better given the offerings, but let’s face it, they have a trapped audience and aren’t trying to impress anyone. To add insult to injury, our meal of two hot dogs, a kids burger meal, a grilled chicken salad, a burger, two fries and a shake was $65., Advised not a dedicated fryer. No gluten free buns and chips cannot be eaten as cross contamination. You can have a salad however, Reliable udis buns. Probably wouldn’t trust cross contamination if I were celiac but they are helpful while on a trip, friendly staff who answer good all the question, The bun was Udi’s, but man, it was good to have a burger and fries. I am here for a conference and this was nearby. May even go back before I leave. I waited until the morning after the meal to review to make sure I did not get sick., I called ahead of time to confirm they could make me something safe for a Celiac. I spoke to Kay who was very helpful and knowledgeable. I ended up having a grilled chicken sandwich and French fries. It was a pretty basic sandwich, but it was SAFE! and she went out of her way to make sure I had freshly cut lettuce, etc so cross contamination would be nonexistent. Very wonderful experience with kind and caring people :-), Awesome, Johnny Rockets has dedicated fryer for fries and gluten free buns with dedicated space for gluten free preparing for food. Absolutely Celiac friendly., Horrible.... There are no options at this location
I asked if they could make the burger in a lettuce wrap and they said they do not have that available
Fries are cross contaminated, This place is awesome definitely coming again for the food. It’s 50s themed it’s amazing, very good to work with me food was good. changed gloves and didn't get sick, Server was amazing but it is not safe for a celiac without cross contamination, they didn’t understand the severity and couldn’t accommodate, There is no dedicated gluten-free menu but the staff assured me they could prepare a burger without cross contamination. The burger was served wrapped in iceberg lettuce. The party itself wasn’t that nice and overall, I wasn’t that impressed. When I inquired about the fryer, I was initially told it was only used for fries but the manager overheard the conversation and clarified that it was also used for gluten containing foods., Gf bread but not buns. Exceptional patty melt, They have gf buns, and we’ve tried it more than once. The food tastes great, but even those in our party who are not gluten sensitive do not feel well after eating here. We probably will not go back., Tasted good, but I had a reaction, Gluten free bun available for $1.29, The fries are cooked in a dedicated fryer. Our waitress was very patient with all my questions. Kept going to check with the manager as to what was gf. Do not eat a hamburger here! They are seasoned with something that contains gluten. Had the grilled chicken sandwich on an Udis bun with fries. Very tasty and no reaction. Only gave it 4 stars because I couldn't have the burger., No longer GF for fries or tots. Fries cooked with tots and their online allergen menu now says that tots may contain gluten traces., If you're gluten intolerant, then they have plenty of gluten free options. However, if you're celiac stick only to the fries (cross contamination everywhere!)., Good burgers. They were very helpful to let me know just what was available gluten-free.

Udis gluten free buns and a designated fryer just for fries so no cross contamination., This restaurant has Udi's hamburger buns- not hot dog. No separate fryer., The staff is amazingly friendly. They have gluten-free buns now., they were really careful about making sure they scraped the grill so I didn't get cross-contaminated but I still did. udi's bun was alright little dry but at least I was able to eat a burger. I think the next time if I go there I won't be eating anything off the grill. staff was really nice they really did try to make sure I didn't get cross-contaminated., Staff was very helpful. Had Udis gluten free buns for burgers. I had a reaction even after telling them that it was an allergy and not a choice.

I have celiac and did not get sick. Tomas was a sweet server & it was very good!, Gluten free bun available, Inside Cedar Point. I was glad we could have fries (they report a dedicated frier) and a plain hamburger patty (without bun) but frustrated that they are still ""out"" of the GF Udi's buns that the menu advertises.

Ate about half before she came back and told me it was regular., I have been here a few times. Although some of the staff understood the importance of GF, we ordered 4 pizza’s, 3 of which were supposed to be GF. However, only 2 of them were. I confirmed as they served us that the 3 were GF and they said yes. However, the pizza was just not like anything I had had before and didn’t look like the other 2, so I asked again. They went back to the kitchen and said “oops, sorry. That ones not gf”. They made new pizza and didn’t charge us for the 1, however, I had already eaten.
I tried going back 1 more time because they also gave us a credit for our next order. They remembered us and the waiter was like “oh yeah, I heard about that. The server was wondering if they should tell you or not. I told them yes, they should”. So, big mistake. Mistakes happen and I get that, but the fact that the servers don’t all realize the importance of GF made me decide I will not be going back to that location., Amazing gluten free pizza!!! Our first time in Ft Collins and so glad we found this spot. The staff were friendly and fairly knowledgeable (immediately asked if it was preference or “allergy”). It did take around 25-30 minutes, which she did advise of, but it was SO worth it. The crust was fantastic and, for a gf pizza, was pretty thick! Well done Garlic Knot!!!, Great gf pizza.

Server not trained!, almost everything is gf! i love the food. friendly and fast service., Food is great but I've felt sick every time Ive eaten here despite asking them to take precautions., I told them I have Celiac and without any other info the server changed her gloves, kept my food wrapped away from any cross contamination risk, and even pulled my pita toppings from the top of a new pan of EVERY TOPING and used a new spoon to avoid any chance of cross contamination. I literally teared up a bit., Watched how they prepared the food and didn’t feel comfortable eating here due to high potential for cross contamination. Left and ate somewhere else., Ordered to go to be delivered to work for lunch. Stated needed GF and asked to change gloves. Everything tasted great!! Apparently too good. Had to leave work and vomited all over inside of car on way home. Will not try again!, Not safe for celiac. They use the serving spoons to spread hummus and such on the gluten pitas, so no possible way to avoid cross contamination. Wish I could just but the gf pitas which are really good!, They got food out of separate containers. Several GF meat and topping options . Very good and reasonable prices, Staff very knowledgable about GF items - she changed her gloves & used separate utensils without me having to ask once I told her I had to eat GF. Delicious Mediterranean food! (Would definitely recommend the falafel!) I am a very sensitive celiac & did not feel sick after eating here., Got very sick from cross contamination, Service wasn’t great and the food was mediocre. Probably won’t go back. But according to their website most of the menu is gluten free., Always have a good experience, staff is quick to change gloves and pull ingredients from bins below to minimize cross contamination. Gf pita is a nice bonus and feels like eating a normal meal., We really enjoyed our lunch at Garbanzos. The service was quick and friendly. The staff was patient and well-informed. I had the gluten free pita with falafel and I loved it. Next time will get the protein, salads and sauces on the plate with the pita on the side. The restaurant is clean and inviting. Well worth it!, I've been here twice. The first time, the server changed gloves and even washed his hands! Everything I ordered was served from underneath the line with fresh utensils. The second time was terrible. I had to insist on everything and it was very frustrating because the server kept insisting that the foods in the line were safe. When you order the gf pita, they wrap it in foil and steam it in the same appliance as the regular pita. One area of my pita was not wrapped properly, so it was likely exposed. Cross-contamination is always a possibility., I was more or less refused service. The guy had a fit when I asked him to change his gloves and if he could reach under the counter. I was absolutely embarrassed. I can’t help having this disease and the restaurant is advertising that they are capable of gluten free., Huge cross contamination risks right in front of me..., Manager said “what’s gluten?” When asked to weigh in on menu items. Avoid!!!, So amazing. Highly recommend. The staff know what they are talking about, and everything was delicious., Not gluten free at all. Gluten free pitas but use some spoons and food so everything is cross contaminated. Bad bad bad, Most everything there is gluten free. The food was really good, Majority of items on menu are GF and are clearly marked as such. Wonderful, flavorful, and fresh meal. Happy to have found it while traveling!, I was highly suspicious when I saw the line everything goes through (starting with a gluten pita mostly). The guy behind the counter did not understand my question about what ingredients were safe (nothing appeared marked). I left- too dangerous for me., Everything is marked on the glass if it’s GF or DF or veg or what not. Have GF pita! Will change gloves, have separate fryer. Can eat falafel! Have lots of sauces to enjoy! And the employees know as well what’s going on., This place has a fryer that just makes fries and chips. The steak is really good and the rice. I definitely recommend this place., I apologize this review is so late. I ate here over the summer and have not had a chance to leave a review. Although the staff was not very knowledgeable about gluten-free the manager was. If I remember right his name was David and he cleaned The entire work area, used plates from a brand new box, and dished my food from the containers underneath that had not been cross contaminated yet. He also made me some gluten-free Pita wrapped in foil to prevent cross-contamination. I felt very cared for at this location during the lunch rush. If only all garbanzos locations took the same care it would be great., Walked in... and the FIRST thing I noticed is that place is CC central.... utensils in contact with the pita, then dunked back into the sauces/ fillings.... and contaminated gloves dunked into the other fix-uns.... walked out.....steer clear of this place....., I was very happy with the options for celiacs. The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable., Very knowledgeable. Lots of options. Workers were great. Gf pita was very good. They toasted it wrapped in foil. Tasty food., Great real food fast. Lots of GF DF options and if you tell them you are Celiac they will serve you from fresh, uncontaminated containers (under the line) with fresh utensils . Very accommodating & a safe place to eat. I also love to get the chips instead of pita and dip them in Baba Ghanouj., I work nearby and I eat here all the time and have never gotten sick (Celiac). The staff is very courteous and knowledgeable and there are tons of options., Second time we've come by to try this place and they have been closed both times (on a Saturday)! So frustrating!, On each of the items labels it states of the item is gluten free, and all but a few are safe. The staff was kind enough to sanitize the environment before beginning to make my meal. My boyfriend got the gf pita bread and he said it was good, it has a hint of sourdough flavor and isn't dry. The falafel here is amazing!, Everything is clearly labeled and the food is delicious and the staff is pretty knowledgeable!, One reason I enjoy visiting the Denver area so much (besides seeing family) is eating at Garbanzo's. I have celiac disease and *have* to eat gluten free. The staff here is a dream to work with. They take care to make sure there is no cross-contamination in anything I order and the food is AMAZING. So good. The falafel is the bomb and their GF pitas are tender and chewy. So so so so yummy.... And for the record - I state I'm celiac and they use clean gloves, get out new containers of sauces and more, and wrap the pita in foil. I ordered a chicken kabob tonight and they made it fresh. I've eaten here a dozen times and have yet to be glutened. I am celiac AND have a severe wheat allergy. It takes a microscopic amount of either to set me off. :), A must to those with Celiac Sprue. There menu is easy to order from on what is gluten free & Lactose free. Thanks to the Server knowledge & labels identifying food allergy info is fantastic. Offer Gluten free & Lactose free pita bread., love that they had everything marked if it was gluten free or vegan., Great gf pitas! Lots of options for gluten free and vegan. Everything is labelled if it is gluten free or vegan. Very knowledgeable and friendly staff!, Even has a Paleo plate now!, Watched them spread ingredients directly onto wheat pitas and place the spatula right back into the ingredients. Hello cross-contamination. Didn't tempt fate here., Love love love. Falafel is GF and so is rice. Everything labeled. Easy, nice staff. Cross contamination ...?? But I didn't have an issue. It was delicious and I will be back. They have GF pita that is delicious, The gluten free pita bread here is AWESOME! It tastes like real gluten. The server knew to change gloves and told everyone else to do the same. I'm so happy there's a Mediterranean food place in town with gluten free pita bread now!, The food is fantastic and they make an effort to offer good GF alternatives. The cross-contamination risk, however, is pretty big as I have personally witnessed them use a scoop to stuff toppings in a pita bread, touching the pita with the scoop and then putting it back into the GF topping container, contaminating the entire container. It's disappointing that they get this aspect of GF prep wrong, yet offer individually-wrapped GF pitas that are protected from cross-contamination. ... The food is delicious and at a great price, their people are very polite, but they are not trained in cross-contamination protocols and I have been glutened here and left the last time without ordering due to the scoop issue. ... Not celiac safe, but probably fine for the mildly intolerant., Staff was trained. The server switched her gloves the moment I said I needed a gluten free meal. All spoons remained in their own container.
The meats that were gluten-free were labeled. I didn't realize that the gyro meat was not gluten-free so I was able to change it before it reached my plate. The server switched her gloves again! So I was incredibly thankful!! Meat is measured in a small container, so I see the potential for cross contamination there. Again, server did not use that container and just placed the meat on my plate.
The gluten-free pita bread was pre wrapped in foil and heated that way to prevent cross contamination. Kudos to the server that I had!!! I was very pleased and she was patient and helpful.
I will say just communicate your needs, stay vigilant and request for things to be done separate, etc...., Cross-contamination central. Delicious food, and most items are GF, but unless you're the first one served that day, your food is likely contaminated by food that's touched wheat pitas, via spoons or bits of rice that were stuffed into a wheat pita then fell out back into the serving bin. A pity, because their falafel (GF) are very tasty. Not a celiac-friendly restaurant., So many delicious options!! My only concern would be the proximity of ingredients to others that aren't GF. I had no reaction to anything and tried just about everything GF they offer. They changed their gloves when I informed them I'm GF, and the entire menu is very clearly marked. Amazing falafel and GF pita!! I will be back many times :), They do a great job of working with food allergy requests, Really good fast Mediterranean food. Will come back again! Everything is clearly marked and they know what they're talking about it., Love this place. Food is great. Good prices. The servers are knowledgeable about what entrees have gluten., Their gluten free pitas are pretty okay while they're hot, but once they cool, not so much. Still, you get plenty of food with a plate or kabob, and its all deliciously seasoned., If you are sensitive to gluten, please don't visit this place. When me and my family came here, we told the server that we were gluten free and she rolled her eyes at us and made our food. The people were judgemental and rude. They made me and my brother share a half serving of meat. The food was okay but too simplistic. There is no gluten free bread or anything so they only advertise gluten free to get more customers. If this simplistic style is just Mediterranean style than I apoligize., We told the girl we needed our order to be gluten free and she acted like she knew what we were asking. I watched her touch the pita from the order in front of us and proceed to grab my bowl with the same glove. I reminded her that she needed to change gloves, and she just said, ""yea, I know,"" and kept the same bowl! Smh!, I love this place.

They will clean the grill if not too busy., I’ve eaten here 3 times and the last 2 times I got sick, I will not be going back. Cross-contamination is a big issue here., Separate workstation to build sandwich, with separate utensils. Allergy protocol there is taken seriously by staff.
I’ve had subs from there several times and have never felt sick.
Good bread too!, Asked if it was gluten allergy or preference and took precautions including changing gloves and preparing in separate, cleaned space., Great gf options. They clean the grill and change gloves., Order here regularly. I let them know up front and they do a good job wiping down to make sandwiches. Glad to find a place I can have a quick sub sandwich, Staff is great! Eaten from here multiple times without any issues. I’ve seen them put together my sandwich and they’re very careful not to contaminate anything., They offer gluten free bread in all sizes. They ask if it’s allergy or preference when you order gf bread. If it’s allergy they automatically change gloves or ask if you’d prefer it. They take some precautions to ensure the space they use and the knife they cut with is clean. Because their sauces come from a squeeze bottle and are not spread on, there’s little chance for cross contamination from the ingredients., Offer GF sub rolls for all sandwiches. When I mentioned a gluten allergy, they cleaned the slicer, used new utensils, put the sandwich on paper, and put on new gloves. Very knowledgeable about cross contamination. One suggestion - ask them to heat the GF bread before making your sandwich., I always love jersey mikes cause they do the gf prep in front of you, and they clean and take it seriously, I watch them open the bread from a separate area, and put it on a mini cutting board! The prep is great, and I never have stomach aches. I think it’s a great place for lunch!, Love Jersey Mike's. The staff is trained so well, they clean the slicer and surfaces, separate utensils, change gloves etc. The food is always fresh and tastes great. I've had both hot and cold subs and I've never had an issue and I'm a super sensitive Celiac., We like that they offer GF bread now, just wish there was a kids menu option too., Udi bread is used. Changed gloves and staff new difference between gluten free and gluten free for an allergy., Excellent service. This location is new and well gladly do special and gluten free orders. Beware the "" juice"" is made of red vinegar and olive oil but the olive oil is half soybean oil. If u have an allergy to soy leave their ""olive oil"" off ur sandwich, Sandwiches have not disappointed. Bread is really tasty and all the various cheesesteaks are our favorite, Unsure... My favorite gf sand which place. Severe celiacs and never had a problem. Delicious!, Negligent and doesn't pay attention to details in notes, I enjoy the turkey & cheese sub when my office orders lunch from Jersey Mikes. It’s nice to be able to order with the group! I’ve never had a reaction., When we told them it was GF they all changed their gloves and wiped everything down, Wow very very impressed. The whole staff knew everything about gluten cross contamination and whelpful in answering questions. They took me very seriously and changed gloves, changed the cutting board, used a dedicated gluten free knife, sliced a new tomato for me, and were in general just very impressive. Did not get sick and am sensitive.... Will definitely be back!... They can do basically any sandwiych GF... Great staff. Will be back!!!, Ordered pickup and my wife grabbed my sandwich. GF bread was good enough, and the sub was excellent!, It's covid so I couldn't stand in there and watch them make it, but I ordered through the app, put a ton of notes asking them to change gloves etc. And I didn't get sick so in my celiac mine they're winners., Horrible service! The staff COMPLETELY lacks knowledge in celiac disease/gluten allergy and cross contamination. When I asked for a gluten free menu the guy points to the bread and says, ""all we have is gluten free bread."" I ask about fresh veggies as I can tell they don't utilize utensils and I was told what they have out is all they have. The guy explained they clean the machine that cuts the meat and they have gluten free bread but that was all. If you have celiac disease or a severe gluten sensitivity I would not eat here, They will clean the grill, change gloves, wipe down counters and keep your sandwich on paper the whole time in case they missed anything when they wiped down.... Everything is freshly made, Imagine paying $4 extra for gf bread. Foh, My husband is celiac and they poisoned him here. It happened only once, but we will not trust Jersey Mike's ever again after this. They do use the same grill as the gluten food and we've seen them clean it before cooking our food, but the guy there that night I guess wasn't trained properly. Shouldn't have to babysit their workers. Do not eat here if celiac... Very poor since not celiac safe, Staff changed their gloves and prepared sandwich on new paper to prevent cross contamination.... Most sandwiches are available gluten free with their special bread.... I would go here again for gluten free., Manager made my sandwich and took care to change his gloves and use a clean tray and knife. They did wipe down the meat slicer to be safe.... Was not able to have the sandwich warmed up because they use the microwave for so many other things.... Restaurant was clean. They are doing the social distancing in the COVID-19 requirements., They were very busy today when we stopped in but they did a great job of making sure everything was celiac safe! Great job thank you!, Separate kitchen space... Great customer service, separate prep area and use of utensils. Very careful. We never get sick and love the cheesesteaks!!!, They did a poor job cleaning off equipment and then used the same mayonnaise and knife as everyone else. We ended up just taking our son to Kroger to pick out something safe rather than let him get sick ☹, Clean the slicer before use, change gloves, wash hands before prepping gf order.... Almost all the subs can be made with the gf bread.... Very informed employees and friendly and eager to help, They clean surfaces, utensils, wash hands and get new gloves, clean slicer etc for all GF orders... I think all subs can be made on GF bread (Udi’s), They offer udis gluten free buns and udis gluten free cookies. I got the gluten free veggie sandwich & I did not get sick. They wash all counter tops and change gloves and clean utensils (have a dedicated gf knife to cut bread) before handling gluten free food... Most sandwiches can be made gluten free, Tested a GF steak and cheese with a Nima gluten sensor and it tested positive for gluten. Not confident in staff’s ability to mitigate cross contamination.... Have had great past experiences but the most reason was contaminated. Try at your own risk, will not be ordering again in the future.... Had great past experiences. Unfortunately the most recent, I ordered a GF steak and cheese and tested it on the Nima gluten sensor. The sub tested positive for gluten. Not confident in the staff’s ability to mitigate cross contamination despite being told it was an allergy., Have been multiple times and they always clean off the surfaces and change their gloves to avoid cross contamination. They are knowledgeable and are always happy to help., They were so accommodating...the girl that helped me went to the back and got the veggies and mayo from the back (so no cross contamination). She also cut the meat and cheese on a separate slicer. They also have gluten free bread. Best sandwich I have had in years!!!, Awesome staff a decent sandwich., Very careful about cross contamination., Informed staff I was celiac, asked about there allergy protocols. Staff told me they can accomodate and have a seperate line for making food. I ordered my sandwich asking for gluten free bun...he relayed the order to someone else. They prepped my sandwich on a back line(I couldnt see) adding toppings from the front line to mine, they had a seperate knife and everything. Got home...was the same bread as my husbands which is not gluten free., Celiac friendly. I have eaten here several times and I've never had a reaction. Just ask for gluten free bread and they will ask if it's by choice or allergy. If you tell them allergy, they take it to the back and prepare it in a separate location., When ordering gluten free they clean the entire area including the slicer. They changed gloves and got all ingredients from the back. They have gluten free bread and keep it completely separate from the regular bread.... Any sandwich can be made gluten free and the gluten free bread is pretty good. They have chips and sometimes individually package gluten free cookies., I am celiac and never had an issue. They use certified gluten free bread (Udis). They ask if you have an allergy and they change out gloves/utensils and make the sandwich in a dedicated gf station., I haven’t eaten in restaurant due to covid so I am not sure what safety precautions they take. I ordered a sandwich on the gluten free bread and though I didn’t get sick I can’t say I really enjoyed my meal. The bread they use is the worse gluten free bread I’ve had. It was super dry and thick but also didn’t hold up at all. Basically from the first bite the whole bread flaked into a million pieces and I had to chug water cause it was so dry. So yes they offer gluten free bread and I assume it’s pretty safe to eat but other than the meats and veggies it’s not very good., One person stayed w the order instead if passing it. Wiped down everything, including the slicer. Alerted rest of staff he was doing gluten free. This has been process each time I’ve eaten here.... Udi’s bread was a bit too much, maybe hollow out a bit before eating. Even had gf cookies and chips were good.... Amazing. Almost any sub can be gf. Bread was softer and they even have Udi’s cookies. They were all very careful about cross contamination., Used to work at a Jersey Mikes before I was diagnosed. There are no dedicated gluten free zones and bread touches almost all the surfaces so I don’t trust it","Matthew,kristy,Amber Eichorn,Catie,Megan,Dave,Mardianne,Kelly,Joey,Marc,Christina,GlutenStinks15,Cecilia&Daniel,Nicole,Jackie,kymaaera,Angelica Lopez,Max,Allison,Michele,Jessica,joshmagner,sh1234,TJ,Kristine,Chelsea,Hannah,Cameron ,Lisa,Matt,Lory Breckler,Terry,lucinka,Karan Anne,Howard,Michelle,Rylie,PCapstick,Tyler,Barbra,Anthony,User,Bobbie,Robert,nikki,Darryl,Maria,Ama Burns,Kian,Jaime,Sarah",CO,5,2,37,80222

Somewhat limited with menu items no green chili or hollandaise sauces were safe. We got the chorizo scramble with the rice pancakes and the carnitas Benedict with no sauces and extra pico. It was a very tasty breakfast and the bottomless mimosas were very nice. They have a homemade chipotle hot sauce that was Superb! The meat was flavorful and good portion and decent pricing. The rice pancakes were thin but had a wonderful consistency and taste. I would return for breakfast again., Great neighborhood breakfast spot with tasty options and knowledgeable/friendly servers! Lots of the egg dishes can be done with a gf English muffin. They also offer a rice-flour based pancake option that’s the big, thin style and they can add toppings. A bonus find if Taylor Ham pork roll (family favorite) - and they will clean grill, use separate pans, bring real maple syrup, etc. If they added a couple more non-egg gf options, we’d give them 5 stars., Good food, seems to be GF friendly., Good food. Lots to choose from, Another good place for celiacs. Good breakfast place, don't overlook it because its in a little strip mall ( you'll forget about that as soon as you're seated).

Staff did not seem to be educated on gluten free. They came back to the table twice to ask my order . I got the mix and match tacos which were marked gluten free on the corn tortilla. I made the same mistake as another reviewer. They were on flour tortilla which I ate half of a taco before realizing, the flour are not large and airy but small and thick in the way corn are. I personally would not eat here again, I eat Mexican frequently and never had this happen., The veggie tacos were fantastic! Everything is labeled GF & V., The corn and flour tortillas look the same and I was served flour tortillas but didn’t realize it until I became sick hours later. Also, my veggie tacos came with bacon on one of them. I’m vegetarian and didn’t realize until I bit into it. They replaced my tacos with the flour tortillas. I don’t think I’ll go back., I LOVE this place. Phenomenal food and service maybe because I came earlier in the day and on a weekday but love the staff, even management. Music/drinks/Food/staff/ all five star., Knowledgable staff. Comprehensive menu. Great drinks. Decent food., Overall, we had a good experience and were well taken care of. Be warned that their menu identifies 85% of the menu as gluten free, but when the wait staff learned we were celiac, they identified a lot of cross contamination. Two waiters and the general manager (Mitch) worked with us to modify our orders to meet our needs. In the end, we were satisfied and felt our meal was safe., Not concerned about allergies at all. I asked multiple questions and was very specific about needing corn tortillas. My fajitas came with flour tortillas that look almost identical to the corn. Unfortunately I ate half of one before I realized. We also have a dairy allergy. Tacos and cheese arrived with cheese on them and there was a side of sour cream that I requested to be left off. I will not return., NOT Celiac friendly. ... I would leave 5 stars on the service, the wait staff and manager were very friendly. ... This restaurant says most of the menu is GF, however they use a shared fryer, which makes it not GF/celiac friendly. I came home sick. Guessing it was either the chips or the refritos if they used oil to freshen them. ... Many items are made in the shared fryer, including the rice..beware., Great atmosphere, gluten free clearly marked on menu and server was super nice!! Best salsa and chips ever!!!, No words can describe what is happening in my mouth! Amazing! Lots of options! Excellent margaritas. Great service!, Menu clearly labeled what contained gluten. Food was awesome. I ordered skillet pork carnitas. Ambiance was nice. Beautiful place Meal was delivered very quick. Only downside was waitress was not very friendly., Menu is well labled for what contains gluten. Chips are GF. Few GF vegetarian options, but what they have is tasty. Server was very supportive around both Celiac and vegetarian needs., Great place to eat. Most of the menu is GF. I have multiple food allergies and the chef did a great job preparing a meal that met my needs. Highly recommend a stop here!, This place was great. Their menu marks what has gluten instead of what doesn't because of the huge selection of gluten free options. Made everything from scratch even several of their drinks. The chips and salsa were great and their fajitas were even better!, Absolutely phenomenal. SO glad we found this place via the app. Great service; they truly get it. Safe for celiacs. Great chips and drinks were strong!!!, So glad I used this app and found this place. The staff was so friendly and didn't make me feel that my celiac disease was an inconvenience for them at all. Most of the menu is gluten free and everything is clearly marked. Everything I ate was delicious and I wish there was one closer to me in Boulder., Very happy here. The food was excellent, the service great, natural ingredients, real fruit in their margaritas. The menu is marked with items that aren't gluten free, and where to ask for corn tortillas instead of flour. I would definitely come back when in the area again (from California)., Always excellent, never have had a problem with gluten here., Food was delicious and staff was very helpful and friendly!

The chef came out and talked with me because I have multiple allergies. I got beef medallions and potatoes that he fixed according to my allergies. The food was wonderful, waiter extremely nice and helpful., This location does an extraordinary job ensuring that you have a safe experience at their restaurant. Chef took my order and hand delivered my salad, meal, and dessert!!! Went above and beyond to make sure I felt comfortable answering any and all questions regarding gluten free options and cross contamination....Would eat here 100 times over!!! Thank you!!!!!, Amazing!!! Best pasta ever and I didn’t react. (I am a celiac for all wondering), Our appetizer and salad was excellent, but I was disappointed when my gf spaghetti turned out to be penne that was tough. They offered to remake but said it would be a bit tough again so we declined. They comped us for my meal and gave us a complimentary gf dessert which was excellent. We would go back but not for pasta. Our food in general was very good and staff was knowledgeable, Really nice and attentive staff, but i definitely got glutened., I stopped in and ordered takeout for dinner. Had a long conversation with the takeout host about gluten free options. He was great and even checked with the kitchen on salad dressings. I got back to my hotel and my entree was regular spaghetti (easy to tell since it wasn't their GF penne shape). And there was a big hunk of bread in the bag.... Called the restaurant and they sent someone to my hotel with a GF entree 40 minutes later. I was super sick later that night. I might dine in at a different location but I'd never do take out again., Absolutely amazing!!!! Traveled to Denver as my husband came here on business. The chef came right to my table and assisted me with ordering. He even gave me a complementary appetizer as I could not eat the rolls! Delicious gf pasta. Most if not all of the sauces are gf. One of the best experiences at a restaurant since I was diagnosed celiac 5 years ago!, AMAZING! Super Celiac friendly and the whole family loves it.♡, went there a few weeks ago. gluten free penne substitute for most pasta dishes. was very good, replaced linguini with gluten free penne with no issue. I don't believe they have a separate kitchen or actively avoid contamination but it was good for my intolerance., The chef came out and spoke to me about my options. I went with the gluten free Alfredo and it was delicious! No side effects., Went her because it had high ratings on the GF app..the chef did come out and talked to me about my options but our server was completely oblivious to what Celiac Disease is...the chef made me feel like I was safe...but at 1am I was awoken by the side effects of being Glutenized...my daughter said she woke up at 2am by the side effects...I can't recommend a place that cross contaminated me...so if you read this and don't agree with my comments, please do not post that I am wrong on your post...I am a highly sensitive Celiac and have been for all my life. I am posting about my experience...which was not good! If you have ever experienced a true cross contaminated night on the bathroom floor...then you will understand what I am saying about this place...I do NOT recommend eating here and I will never go back!, Delicious GF pasta! I haven't eaten pasta in over a year., Very friendly - the chef came out and took the order and saw it all the way through. They make everything from scratch and delicious! A great place for a special evening., Yes they cistomize but the pasta is blah. Environment is like over priced country buffet seating. So not worth it! Go to Carabas!!!, Expensive, but well worth it. Super gluten free friendly I love lovelove the sauce! The first time I went I had the chef come up to my table, and ask me what I wanted to eat., I rarely eat at chain restaurants, but I had a gift card so I gave it a try...what a colossal disappointment!!! The GF noodles were dry and chewy and there was barely any sauce! The red tomato and olive oil sauces were both bland. You do get a large quantity for your money, but extremely poor quality. The staff was fairly helpful about accommodating my needs, but this place is truly a sorry excuse for an Italian restaurant. If you want high quality GF Italian food at a reasonable price, check out Abrucis and Saucy Noodle Ristorante!, This place is pretty good for a carb indulgence! Definitely worth the price as you get a plate of noodles to take home as well. Happy hour is great, tomatoes & mozzarella is always fresh and delicious., The gluten free pasta texture could be better, it is a bit tough/cheesy., Chef came out to talk over the GF options. We were more than happy with the meal! Chicken Marsala was yummy! We will definitely return. Bonus- our kids were thoroughly entertained by the magician (Tuesday nights only I think)., Best gluten free meal I've ever had!!! Our server, JC, and the Sous Chef, Chon Guy, gave us five star service!!! Many gluten free options in each course! They served multiple kinds of GF pasta and sauces, and their house dressing was delicious! Large portions we couldn't finish in one sitting so JC packed them up for us to go completely separated with the GF meals labeled! Very knowledgable staff! I wish we had a Maggiano's in Alaska!, Host and wait staff super knowledgeable about both celiac disease and being gluten free - all pasta (minus the lasagna and ravioli) can be made gluten free, waiter stated that they the waiter fill out allergen card to alert staff and also told how the cook staff avoids cross contact (changes gloves, changes cookware, etc)... Good gluten free pasta! Pretty much everything can be made gluten free with exceptions to the ravioli and lasagna. Cook staff knows to remove breading croutons etc when shown allergen card marked gluten free. And if you order a pasta dish, you get one to take home at no extra cost!... Open during COVID-19, The server asked immediately if there were any allergies and then explained what they do to accommodate... They told me almost everything could be made Gluten free. The exceptions were Lasagna and ravioli. Makes sense to me. Food was amazing! I has the shrimp scampi! Portions were also huge!, The chef comes out and makes sure to answer all your questions. Your food is made separate from the rest so there is no cross contamination. Also flagged when it comes out so there is no mix up... Absolutely my favorite place to eat. I have never been sick there. I’ve been there so many times and the chef comes out each time. All their food is good but I highly recommend the chicken fettuccine, it won’t disappoint, Staff was nice- stated they could make almost any of the pasta dishes gluten free minus the stuffed pastas. They brought us out gluten free bread to start which was awesome! I had the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and it was good, not great. Had to add seasons. The chicken was pretty bland. They do send you home with another pasta dish on top of the one you ordered at no extra cost which is awesome!, This place was delicious! Very accommodating, the chef came out to speak to me about all of my options, and I enjoyed the food I ordered! I will definitely be coming back here., All of the sauces are GF and they have a GF penne. Staff is knowledgeable about what is and is not GF., I had the baked ziti and it was delicious. Did not get sick. Generous portion. Our waiter was extremely attentive to our gluten allergy and offered other options to compensate for items we couldn’t have. Excellent service and great food, Not only did they have tons of gluten free pasta that the chef talked personally to me about, and not only did it taste amazing, they fresh baked gluten free bread for me. Absolutely amazing, and I love coming here for anniversaries., The staff was great and knew what I could eat. I ate here two nights in a row (I was a conference) and had a great experience with both bartenders. I got pasta both nights (yahoo!) and it was yummy. Definitely recommended for celiacs if you are in town—just make sure you speak up about your allergy!, I ordered a gluten free pasta Mediterranean. It tested positive low gluten on the Nima tester. They sent the 👨‍🍳 who was unable to understand why it would test positive. They were nice and made me the plain garden salad as I requested. It was good., Staff was knowledgeable about celiac & there was a good selection of gluten free dishes. My daughter was able to eat a delicious, safe meal AND they made gluten free bread for her!, Good GF pasta with delicious marinara sauce. Chef came to the table as soon as we told our waiter we were GF. Chef personally makes GF meals as part of their protocol. He asked questions to confirm no other allergies as well. We've been back several times, and it was great every time. We will definitely be back!, Love, love, live Maggianos. This location pays attention to detail, we felt safe eating here and everyone loved their food. ... The chef came out to take my daughters order (she has celiac disease). We’re planning to go back next weekend. ... Also, the wait staff is perfectly attentive, very helpful and super nice., The chef personally explained the precautions he takes in the kitchen for my GF pasta: dedicated pot, fresh water, clean tongs, etc. The meal was yummy and I didn't feel sick!, I am recently diagnosed. I had shrimp scampi once with GF pasta and it was good. Another occasion, I had GF pasta with Alfredo, I found regular fettuccine noodles throughout about mid way through. Won’t be eating it again any time soon., What an experience! We had six gluten-free members in our party of 16. I had set up a menu were at least half of the dishes could be done gluten-free and they went above and beyond doing the entire menu gluten-free. We tested several of the dishes with our Nima sensor and they all came out gluten-free. Our waiter Addison was very knowledgeable about celiac disease. It was a wonderful experience for our party to be able to try so many different dishes and not get sick. Highly recommend the chop salad, spinach and artichoke dip, chicken piccata which they made a gluten-free version, the braised beef falls apart with your fork and The crème brûlée is fabulous! Highly recommend this restaurant for gluten-free and not gluten-free parties!, Celiac . Very knowledgeable staff . We tested our GF pasta w Nima and it was safe ., Great GF options. The waiter asked if we had any dietary restrictions. When I said I had celiac, one of the chefs came to our table to explain the options. This was on Christmas Eve! It put me at ease as I was very nervous about eating out on such a busy night., I used to love this place and never had a problem until today. I just got so gluten sick immediately after eating here. Maybe i didn’t specify my allergy clearly enough but if you go here make sure you do., I had the BEST pasta with Alfredo sauce, as someone with celiac it was so nice to be able to eat one of my old favorites. The chef even came out and talked with me about all of my options and was very accommodating. Will definitely be back., This place is a must! The chef came to my table told me what he recommends and what he can do. Mainly any thing on the menu he can make gluten free. I got the big ziti! Also had gluten free bread rolls. I will definitely be coming back to this place!, Ate here for a work function, all employees promised that the gluten free options were easily available and the food tasted great coming out. Unfortunately this location must have no idea what cross-contamination is because I'm suffering from my typical glutening symptoms. Ate the ceasar salad without croutons, grilled chicken and veggies, and the creme brulee. Do NOT eat here if you are celiac or have a very low gluten tolerance., The chef comes out to the table to verify what they are making and that gluten is not in it. They are aware of cross contamination. This makes me feel much more comfortable. Delicious food and many options!, Not gluten friendly. They could care less. The food tasted horrible. Will not return, I had a really good experience here. I got gluten free baked ziti and my friend got regular ziti. I was really freaked out because there were no indicators/markers on the plate to show the difference. But the waiter explained the difference in pasta used for gluten free meals. I ate it and had no issues., I’m intolerant, don’t have CD, and I got sick here twice. I stick to a Low FODMAP diet, so perhaps it was an allium and not a gluten issue. But in either case, I did not feel the server took my food issues seriously. ... I live nearby and my son loves it here, but we won’t be back., NOT Celiac friendly. The GF pasta is cooked in the same water as the regular pasta, contaminating it and making it no longer GF!, The staff was very accommodating here! I did family style with a large group and they were able to bring me gluten free options of every course., Delicious gf pasta. Be sure to let them know you’re celiac, I ordered a gluten free pasta and had several regular pieces of spaghetti mixed in. The chef and manager came to the table to apologize, comped the meal, and offered gift cards to come back. The chef essentially said it was a “busy night in the kitchen and a noodle might of fallen in.” Yet there were several mixed throughout. I’m not sure if they use the same utensils or it’s pre made sauces. I thought it might be a fluke thing but apparently this has happened to almost every person who ordered GF. Do yourself a favor and avoid the pasta dishes- aka don’t eat here., Pasta taste amazing, chef comes out and talks to you before making your meal, Told several staff members that I have Celiac and need gluten free. I was given regular pasta. Spent the evening sick in the bathroom., For a Celiac, the chef coming out and paying attention is a no-brainer. Had an issue with take out once because just dealing with that person, who was new, so be super clear, but no issues with in restaurant ever., We heard this restaurant was rated the best chain for folks with allergies and I saw many great reviews on Find Me Gluten Free so we went in with high hopes. I was very disappointed by how few options I had to choose from. They do not have gluten free bread (so no bruschetta), most of their appetizers are breaded and/ or cooked in a shared fryer. They have ONE GF pasta choice (penne) that they can convert SOME of their dishes with. The pasta wasn't cooked well and was a bit rubbery. Limited dessert menu but I will say they do a great creme brulee., Really pleasantly surprised! Used the Nima on a Caesar salad and GF pasta and both came back fine. Good option in the area., Was in town for a conference and so glad I ate here! Not only was it delicious, there were SO many options and our server right off the bat asked if anyone had a food allergy. He then explained what I could eat or modifications that could be made, and upon ordered my salad (the chopped starter salad - which was DELICIOUS!) and our server suggested I leave off the crispy pancetta because even though it itself is GF, it was apparently cooked in a fryer shared with the calamari so he suggested I omit it from my salad which was so appreciated! Portions were huge, food was delicious, and atmosphere was neat. Definitely book a reservation ahead of time if you can - we had one and by the looks of the line it saved us a lot of time. Definitely would return here!, Delicious gluten free food! Amazing service! The waitress notified the chef of our dietary restrictions and the chef came to our table and spoke directly to us, giving us options to choose from. After the meals were served, the chef returned to ask us how everything was. The waitress also returned a few times to ask how everything was. The dinner was delicious and I will definitely return to Maggianos next time I visit Las Vegas., Who would’ve thought Maggiano’s was able to successfully accommodate someone with Celiac?? Well they can! (At least at this location). I hadn’t been to a Maggiano’s since I was diagnosed and was a little skeptical. But they blew me away. The manager Jake personally went over the options and along with our server Katie, made sure my meal was safe. Caprese appetizer, gf pasta (ALL of their sauces are GF), and even creme brûlée dessert. Perfect meal, absolutely delicious with no reaction. Can not wait to go back!!, I am so impressed! Not only was our server familiar with celiac disease, but the chef actually came out to speak to us about our planned order, providing personal recommendations and a great explanation of how they safely prepare gluten free dishes. This was such a great experience, and the first to make this celiac’s dining experience a relaxed one!, Fantastic experience! Chef Brandon came to our table to tell me what was safe and to take my order. He also offered me a gluten free bread loaf and a complimentary GF appetizer. I have a wonderful meal. The staff was amazing. Highly recommend this place! We’ll be back!, Chef Alex came out and inquired specific allergies. Grilled chicken and veges-delicious. Staff very friendly and accommodating., Very good with gluten-free, especially celiac. Food is fantastic, and you get get one to take home for FREE!, I’ve eaten here 2 times. The first time I ordered pasta and had no problems with it and it was delicious. The second time I ate there, I ordered the same meal and noticed the noodles were a different type than the last time. When I asked about it, I found out that they had given me non gluten free noodles. Luckily I hadn’t eaten any yet. They fixed the mistake and brought out the correct meal, which I had no problem. Staff needs to be more attentive. I won’t go back., The first time I went here, they told me they could make chicken parm gluten free, so I ordered that. Well, what I got was an unseasoned piece of grilled chicken with an unmelted piece of cheese on top and some tomato sauce. Not good. The second time I went here, I ordered gluten free pasta. The pasta was undercooked, the sauce was watery and bland. I’ve never gotten sick from eating here, but the food is awful and I wouldn’t recommend this place., Amazing GF pasta with lots of variety and options! Staff was very helpful and understanding., They seem to try to be careful about cross contamination. Two out of our three GF dishes came out correctly. They put croutons on the salad. The food was blah though. We won’t be back., Our server was not well informed.... got sick - everyone else seems to have had good experiences, Chef comes to your table to understand your dietary restrictions and then custom prepares and cooks you a meal. 100 percent celiac safe when you talk to the chef. The food taste great and the service is excellent!","Judy,Debbie,adrienneb,Sydney,Shelly,Kelly,Elizabeth,JB,Frgrtw - celiac,Georginia,Alexa,simplemomof3,Eve,Brie,Moana,Ella,User,User,Pamela,Kate Miller,DragonZFly,ac00,Maddie,Jaxon,Liz,Bri,Katie ,paige,Anna,Vivian,Jake,Anya,gluten free gal,Gwen,Andrew,Jeanette,Dené,Nicole,GFGirl,Kimberly,Dawn,Kailee,rachel,Justine,Haley,Georgina,goofy,Shelby,Cari,Erin,Kylie,Paige Pelot,Katie,Anne,Monica,JBNYC,MeggieLou,Olivia,Kiersten,Elaine,oceanawa,Rachel,Christine,JCL,zduck33,Kristen Heinrich,Ari,Rylie Foster,FoodieWithCeliac,tmfife,Steve S.",CO,28,11,57,80202-4265

I've also had the Aspen skillet and it was good., I always order a skillet or something similar without any bread as they toast it all in the same toaster.

Never again., the nce hostess informed us everything was contaminated and that they weren't celiac friendly. we choose not to eat here. busy place., They have so much gluten free options and its so tasty, I have only eaten here once. I recommend that gluten free customers forgo looking at the menu and just concentrate on the individual sides as this is the only gluten free food they have. Disappointing that they don't have gluten free options for the meals they offer but my meal was good and satisfying. The gluten free toast was over the top good. The place is very small so be prepared to wait a long time on a busy morning. But it is worth the wait., A delicious experience. Waitress was very knowledgeable about Celiac. No dedicated GF menu but items are marked on menu and they are able to make many items GF. We will coming back before our vacation is over., Lots of GF selections.

We ordered Pad Thai Woon Sen (bean thread noodle) and Massaman Curry., Delicious! Lots of GF options on the menu. I ordered GF Pad Thai and explained that I have celiac. Also ordered some veggie spring rolls that were GF but I used my own GF peanut sauce just to play it safe (we got the order to go)., Food was great! The wine wasn’t good so I will order tea next time. Items are marked GF and GF vegan., We just ate there last night and I was in pain all night. The staff did not take it seriously when I told them, it felt like they didn’t understand., Absolutely amazing gluten free pad thai. Menu is clearly marked, and staff understand celiac. This is my go-to!, amazing food! menu is clearly labeled. I had a soup and a curry, with no complaints about either. would absolutely eat here again!, A few good dinner selections. But some of the curries have sauce that is so heavy and one can only eat so much Pad Thai. They need to find a way to do a gluten free stir fry or something., This one is very good too. Clear marked gf menu. Had no problems. Some times their hot tea tastes weird compared to other times, Outstanding place to eat a good gluten free meal. The price is good for how good the food is., Lots of great GF options as well as vegetarian/vegan. One of my favorites!, I ordered delivery here last night with clear notes about celiac and cross-contamination. When the food arrived nothing was marked for allergens or anything but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. As I ate my beef pad thai I found shrimp (I specifically requested no shrimp), so that’s when I really started to worry. Now today I am super sick and definitely glutened. Beware of delivery I guess., Delicious! Many gluten free dishes, cooked separately., GF satay chicken is delicious. Haven't gotten sick and we eat there all the time. Just make sure to get their items that are GF., Unfortunately had to leave. They label food items GF, however all items are cross contaminated. Same fryer and same wok used., Great flavor and good selection of Gluten Free items. the best Tom Gah in Denver., I've eaten here probably about 20 times since moving to Denver and have never had an issue. The pad thai and tom yum soup are particularly flavorful here., I ways have a good GF experience here! Can't go wrong with SwingThai., I ate their twice and got sick twice. I had the GF pad thai on a Wednesday and was sick for almost a week. I thought it might have been another restaurant. So I went back again 9 days later on a Friday. Had the peanut curry with chicken. Sick again. This time much worse. Both times I went was around 7 at night. They clearly mark things gluten free and on both occasions the server said the items are prepared gluten free, not substitutions. So...there must be cross contamination. There's a bit of a language barrier there so not sure how much they know about preparing things in separate pans, avoiding cross contaminant free cooking. There's a ton of soy sauce being used for sure. If you order the side item of steamed vegetables, they are literally drowning in soy sauce, which I didn't touch of course. It may be a safe place for less strict GFers but if you're a Celiac or have a gluten zero diet, I would swing on down the road to somewhere else. Danger danger., Stopped at their Tennyson location, very tasty and quick. Even better, no gluten reaction., Awesome pad thai!!!!, Amazing gluten free Pad Thai ever !!!! Great customer service make sure you try it, I am in Denver for work, and this was my first stop after settling in. They have a clearly labeled menu, great service, and an excellent Pad Thai! Will definitely be back again., This place is delicious. This is my go to place when I go out with friends who are not gluten free. Tom Ka Gai is my favorite soup and both the pad thai and the curries are great. Definitely recommend., Never had a problem here. Been coming here for years. Always enjoy their pad Thai and never had any pain. Their portions seem smaller at this one but might be me, Clear gf menu good amount. Pad Thai is the best on Denver very flavorful alway good service and price. Tom yum is good too. I hear its vegan without fish sauce. I hope so. I drive 35 miles one way to eat here, Love love love this place! Best Thai I have ever had and I have never had a problem with contamination, mayby great for the ""trendy gluten-freers"" . ..but if you have celiacs..steer clear!!

The 2 managers we see here always make sure my son and I are taken care of. Great place to eat., Be careful here. I took my son with celiac and explained he was gluten free and asked for soft corn tortillas. They gave him the small flour tortillas. We caught it quickly but they are not very educated. Nor did they seem to care much., Since my diagnosis with celiac's, it's been a pain to go out for a quick lunch with my husband, who is not GF. Chipotle is a great option for us; he can get his giant burrito and I just order the burrito bowl. I do miss the tortillas, but the bowls are tasty and I've never had a reaction after eating at any chipotle location., Chipotle does not have a gluten free menu but instead has a list of gluten-containing ingredients to avoid. Cross-contamination is a concern, however, so let the person taking your order know that you are gluten free and if you need them to take the proper precautions.
From their website: ""If you avoid gluten, don't eat our flour tortillas. If you are highly sensitive to gluten and would like us to change our gloves, just let us know at the start of your order. You should be aware items containing corn, including corn tortillas (chips, soft corn, and crispy corn tortillas) and corn salsa, may have a small amount of gluten from potentially co-mingling with gluten-containing grains in the field.""... Chipotle is one of my ""go to"" places. I visited this location while in town and it was great., Traveling with celiac can be emotionally draining. I walked in and asked if they were familiar with what gluten is, no hesitation and was answered yes, gloves off, hands washed, new gloves on and started changing utensils. All the employees seemed to know how to handle things to keep me safe. A thank you to the employees there is not really enough as the same restaurant down the road looked at me like I was crazy when I asked about gluten free options. Great lunch with great service, can’t beat that!😊, They’re always willing to Change gloves and I feel safe eating there., I always get sick from this place. I mention my allergy and they change their gloves/ get separate spoons but they put the spoons in the same main containers.... their chips are NOT gluten free. They told me they were and I got very sick not educated at all apparently, Had no clue what gluten free is despite their menu offering a gluten free tortilla or taco shell., Every filling is gf.
The only thing not gf is the tortilla. Which is sad because real tortilla are made from corn not wheat.
Take the bowl then, Will wash hands, change gloves and use disposable scoopers if you inform them of your ""allergy."" Everything is gluten free except for the burrito wraps. The shredded cheese and lettuce is grabbed with their gloves so it would be cross contaminated. They will get fresh from the back if you ask. I just try to avoid going when it's busy as to not hold up the line. 🤷🏼, I asked them to change gloves because of an allergy to the tortilla. He immediately dropped the tortilla he was holding directly over top of the rice containers. Then washed his hands, changed gloves and grabbed the empty tortilla wrapper. He crumpled it up threw it away and then asked if I wanted a fresh tortilla and opened the new tortillas..... Need I say more?, i found a long strand of hair in my burrito and the rice was definitely undercooked, i could taste how hard some rice were. the meat was dry and too bland. everything was too salty and i couldnt even finish my food. TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!, They refused to serve me, citing cross-contamination. I even emailed their headquarters. They said no.... They refused to serve me, citing cross-contamination. I even emailed their headquarters. They said no.... They refused to serve me, citing cross-contamination. I even emailed their headquarters. They said no., Most things here are naturally gf, and staff will change gloves if asked.... Bowls, tacos, and salads can be gf, as are chips and even the queso, Many delicious gluten free options, I have been going to this location for years and have never had an issue with an employee not changing their gloves and wiping down the counter... Just say you have a gluten allergy and they will go change gloves!, We travel alot and give Chipotle for a quick easy meal. I am C but say gluten allergy for ease of explanation. They changed gloves. Were very helpful and kind., I got sick, not celiac friendly, Wipe down the counters/where they make the food, change gloves, utensils, and get fresh toppings specifically for allergies... quality and quantity is about the same as if someone wasn’t ordering gluten free... Manager trained a new worker right in front of me and he was extremely knowledgeable and careful about cross contamination., DO NOT GET CHEESE ! I repeat do not get cheese. Even if employees change gloves the cheese is still extremely contaminated. Watch the employees hands as they make someone's food. The first thing they do is touch a tortilla with their glove. The last thing they do is touch the cheese WITH THEIR GLOVE., Always have been knowledgeable and changed gloves and pulled food from fresh containers to avoid cross contamination when informed., Stopped by on our way to South Dakata. They did a great job with preparing my food safely!, When I was here and mentioned I had celiac, staff wiped everything down, took out old spoons from the containers, washed hands/changed gloves, then put got clean utensils and new lettuce. Didn’t even have to ask them to change gloves or get new utensils! Very well trained!, Chipotle ALWAYS gets it right! They wash hands, change gloves, switch utensils, & inform all of the staff down the line! They’re the best & ROCK SOLID for a celiac, especially during travel!... Corn based & fantastic! The only flour in the kitchen is the large burrito wraps, all else is GF!... Eating here is 100% safe, 100% of the time🔥, The only thing with gluten here is the tortillas. Get a bowl, and you won't have any problems at all. I've gone many times without even mentioning my allergy with no problems at all., Most of the time I don’t even have to explain. I just say that I have celiac and they change their gloves and get clean spoons. And they don’t touch the serving spoon to anyone’s food.... The only thing that has gluten is the tortilla.... It’s my go to place for lunch or dinner, Love this place! It’s my favorite fast food place to go to because the only thing that isn’t gf is their flour tortillas., No precautions taken at all. If you wait in line and watch them, it’s basically gluten city. Asking them to change gloves (or put some on because they often don’t wear any) is irrelevant because they touch the flour tortillas with all utensils and allow everything to contact other items. Frequently they’ll overfill and put an ingredient BACK in the tray. So there’s massive x-contamination. DANGER!, They have gloves on and a plexiglass in front of the food and during this crisis they have masks on at all times... You can have a bowl with the same toppings as a burrito, This is seriously the most conscientious Chipotle I have ever eaten in. I live nearby and eat here about once a month. They change all the spoons, wipe down the counter and get out fresh lettuce for me. I have never gotten sick at this location. They are the best. Just let them know before you order and they will take care of you. I am not celiac but very sensitive., They did not change their gloves. Told me they ran out of separate toppings. Same work space... It May have just been this location because usually all chipotles are a safer option, but they told me they ran out of toppings and just threw what they could in my bowel. The same toppings that were touched by flour tortillas and I’m sure there was cross contamination! Truly disappointing! 1 Star, Staff didn’t know what to do . Needed to be asked to put in clean gloves and reminded to use clean utensils. The last time I went to this location I thought they were knowledgeable and did a nice job. Today’s crew had not been trained properly. Also their COVID-19 precautions were very lax. Masks worn improperly or around their necks. Probably won’t be back.... Their COVID-19 precautions were very lax. Masks worn improperly or around their necks. Probably won’t be back., Honestly, I’ve gotten sick eating here twice mostly because I do not think the staff cared about my allergy. Only at a few bites and got sick quick. I ordered according to their online menu that was GF, They do wipe down the counters and change their gloves after washing their hands. They take out the condiments straight from the bag below the buffet style service., The staff was polite and changed gloves when I ordered my rice bowl. However, I noticed as they made someone else's burrito that the serving spoons touched the flour shell and then they put the spoon back in the container. I got extremely sick and suspect it was from cross contamination on the spoons., I have a very sensitive gluten intolerance and every time I try their food I get my symptoms... Only on their website/ nutrition info you can find gluten free information, They are very nice and will always change gloves when asked. I have never in my life gotten sick, and I have eaten here a lot.... If you eat here you cannot get a burrito or a taco, but you can get a bowl! The bowls have all the same stuff that the burritos and tacos have, except for the shell/wrap/tortilla. Everything they put inside the food is gluten free. The chips are also all gluten-free corn chips., They do use flour wraps. But if you tell the worker you are gluten free they will change their gloves, change the spoons, and should also change the lettuce and cheese containers since they stick their hands in with the gluten gloves... Very yummy of course. Gone here for years., Kudos to the manager who upon learning that one of the meals was for a celiac (gluten free) person stepped in and with GREAT personal and serving care assured that there was no cross contamination. 5 Stars for the extraordinary care that was exercised, Workers will change gloves, wash hands, wipe down counter, and bag meals separately. They are compliant and very kind!... Everything at Chipotle is gluten free except the tortillas., Everything at Chipotle is gluten free except the flour tortillas. I LOVE having so many choices!!!, They’ve definitely gone downhill. Last time I got their food, it wasn’t very good (dry chicken, missing ingredients) and I was sick afterwards for several days. Can no longer recommend, I love chipotle! They never disappoint, they always give you a good amount of food. I usually get a bowl and most items on their menu are gluten free and celiac safe., The folks working here were super conscientious about changing gloves, wiping the counter, and using new tongs when I told them of my gluten allergy. The food was great and I feel great!, Cross contamination is high if they don’t change gloves or use fresh utensils. Not Celiac safe. Informed them of this but my meal had evidence of other salsas and meat, so it appears utensils were not changed even though requested. Stopped eating as soon as saw this but still having gluten reaction, Will change gloves, wash hands, and get separate cheese and lettuce if you ask. It really depends on the person you get when you order though. I’ve had both really good and really bad experiences. Most of the time the workers are very friendly but I’ve had a few of the workers get visibly irritated when I tell them I have celiacs.... The food is always good. I love getting the rice bowls and they’re fantastic.... I would give it 5 starts if some of the employees weren’t so rude. A few get visibly upset when they have to wash their hands and change their gloves. It’s just an unsettling feeling when they’re making your food and it’s honestly just really rude., Delicious clean ingredients and they’ll change their gloves and spoons if you tell them you’re gluten free., I've eaten at other chipotles and been ok, but I'm having a major wheat reaction this morning. It's possible it's one of my other sensitivities, but none of them give me this reaction that I know of. ... When I ordered, I told the server about my restrictions. He didn't change his gloves like I've seen at other franchises, nor replace the serving utensils. Like an idiot, I didn't ask him to because I didn't anticipate it being a big deal. And I didn't want to make his life harder during the pandemic. But... Ow., Will wash hands and change gloves if you ask.","Cathie ,Stephanie,Anna,Sara,JW,Mic,Keena,merilyn,Lauren,Marcduf,Kassie,Mark,Luna,Marsha,Meghan,Leanne,Caleb ,Monique,Katie,aanya,Wil,Ttomeo,Mike,Elizabeth,Marcie Ellen,Zach,Krista,Amelia,Joey,Lucy,Corbin,KarenW,Breanna,chris,LeeAnna Collier,Madalyn,Michelle,Courtney,Sarah,LaÉabha,Brenna Tkac,Tom,Nora,Jenny,Suzanne,Maia,Celia,Amy,JillianKara,Talia,jennifer,K,sophie herrema",CO,5,2,36,80206

Best GF pizza we have found. My celiac daughter got very sick the last time we went. Classic accidental gluten exposure symptoms. Disappointing., Literally the best gf pizza I have ever had. Sweet and accommodating staff, they even gave me gf crust to dip into their spinach artichoke dip which was creamy and delish!, Delicious GF pizza, with no additional upcharge for being GF. Staff is mostly knowledgeable about gluten; however, the server did put my pizza in the same box as my family's gluten pizza. When she realized this she did give me another GF pizza on the house though., GF pizza is expensive and not the best I've had. I've been there twice and have not gotten sick (I always make a big deal about how severe my celiac is when otdering...)., The GF pizza is really good, but a little over priced for what you get. I had a gluten reaction once after ordering delivery online. Much better to go in person and talk with the kitchen manager to request extra precaution., Best GF pizza ever!, Staff was very careful to prevent cross contamination. Very tasty... reviewed too soon I guess. Sick as heck. Some kind of significant cross contamination. Sadness. I loved this place. ... Returned another time, had no problems on the second visit. So, this place is hit and miss for celiacs., Great pizza. No issues. Ordered online, GF pizza was yummy. I highly recommend the artichoke dip. They offered gf bread to go along with the appetizer(which was just a plain pizza crust). We ordered appetizer and 14” gf pizza. Plenty for two people and left overs. Would definitely visit again., I am celiac and have ordered gluten free pizza from here. I know gluten free dough is hard but theirs get really hard quickly. I can't say if they have a dedicated space for gluten free pizza. The toppings we're good but didn't love the crust., Patxi’s Pizza has gf thin crust. Knowledgeable servers reviewed the process and assured us it’s safe (with usual caveats about not being a gluten free kitchen). We had vegan gf thin crust cheese and gf vegan classic veggie thin crust. Tested crust and sauce with Nima tester and it passed. Pizza tastes great too., I know someone who works here and they told me the gluten free pizzas do not have a separate space. They share the same spot in the oven cooking with the other regular pizzas. Wouldn’t recommend if you are celiac or have a severe gluten allergy, Started of promisingly but my Coeliac wife was served a regular Gluten containing base after ordering GF and telling the server she was Coeliac. If you do eat here double check when your pizza comes out!, I do not recommend this location. I asked several questions, and was not satisfied with their answers. The 3 people I talked to didn't know what celiac was, and they use the same cutter for GF and regular pizzas. They said they wipe it off in between with a rag, but when they held up the rag, it was covered in flour., Server was super helpful and they have a lot of gf options. He said the pizzas are pre-packaged and they prepare them separately. No complaints from me!, Best gluten free pizza I have found. Tastes more like they make it themselves. A lot of pizza places obviously buy the same crusts from somewhere that are..meh. Now if Patxi’s can only make their deep dish GF.... sigh, I can dream., GF pizza was great. servers seemed stressed and overworked, but most were doing their best. Probably do take out., Great gf pizza and caesar no croutons with anchovies. The bottom of the crust looks like the closest thing to glutened pizza I've seen and it is light, not too chewy and the end bits are tasty. It's a beer and wine place but they have Angry Orchard, so life could be worse. ... Keep in mind that you are in San Francisco and things. just. move. more. slowly. here. I asked for a small ramikan of marinara with my pizza. It took 22 minutes to reach me. If I wanted it cold I could have gotten it after about 10 minutes. Apparently, they dont have a large pot of the bubbling goodness in the back. So. Ok. But 22 mins? Not sure why it was that hard and certainly a reasonable ask given it's a pizza joint. That said, the pizza is really good if you are seeking gf pizza in SFO. Def in my top 3 thus far.... The ambiance is laid back and neighborhoody. This is not on a main drag. Come along or with a party. It is a family-friendly establishment., I called ahead and found out they buy their GF crust pre-made (so its not made in the kitchen with the rest of the gluten pizza) The GF pizza I got was excellent, and I didn’t get sick from eating there., The gf pizza is delicious! The homemade crust was crunchy and tasted great! I have celiac and have been here several times now with no problems. Gluten free options are clearly marked on the menu and the wait staff is very knowledgeable., I ate here and got sick after and i know someone who works here and said the staff does not care about allergies, Great food and service! They have a dedicated gluten free kitchen and had plenty of vegan options! Staff was knowledgeable!, Love Patxis! Delicious gluten-free pizza - now offered in two sizes - and they’ll even serve the artichoke dip with gluten-free pizza crust if requested (to substitute the crostinis). They also have Angry Orchard Cider. Love their food, friendly and prompt service and great place for lunch, dinner or to catch a sports game., delicious glutenfree pizza with various option, A bit over priced but it's an option, gf pizza is literally the only gluten-free options they have. I've had better at another pizza place in town and the cost was less., The staff had great knowledge of what is gluten free. What I loved most is that my husband is allergic to dairy and they had dairy free cheese. It’s been a long time since he was able to have cheese on a pizza., Had a slice of gf pizza delivered to a birthday party. Cherry tomato and spinach pizza was delicious (even when a little cold) and I didn’t get sick! Next time I’ll eat more slices!!, Paxti's actually takes care now to say that they do not prevent cross-contamination. I used to be able to eat here without noticable side effects, but the last two times I became incredibly sick. However, I have increasingly become more sensitive to low amounts of gluten. I wouldn't risk it anymore and would encourage anyone who gets severe symptoms to stay away., Had their GF pizza a few times while visiting San Jose - good pizza, and safely gluten free., Pizza was so good!! Friends that aren’t GF still ate it and could tell the difference in texture. Did not get sick., Ordered 2, 10 inch gluten free pizzas. One pepperoni and the spinach pizza. Both tasted fine. Wait time wasn’t too long., The BEST gf pizza and toppings. Dairy free Daiya vegan cheese an option too. Excellent salads., Pizza was great! The waitress told me the gf pizza is cooked on a separate rack from the ""normal"" pizzas. They can't guarantee no cross-contamination, but basically no restaurant wants to unless they're dedicated gf anyway., Beautifully delicious thin GF pizza, knowledgeable staff., Loved this place! The service was excellent - my daughter forgot to mention that she needed her pizza to be GF and our server could not have been nicer about it. The GF thin crust was the best I've had. Great food, great service, great vibe! Don't miss it!, This is one of the Patxi's locations that has gluten-free options (including an awesome GF pizza crust.) GF options are called out on the menu, but you can also make some things safe with minor alterations (no crutons on salads, ask to get the bread on the Burrata appetizer replaced with a GF pizza crust, etc.) Be aware that the sausage contains wheat but the rest of the meats are fine., Have eaten here several times and never got sick. Pizza delicious and non-GF really like their deep dish. Very knowledgeable and accommodating., Vey good food and kind, responsive service. They offer gluten free, dairy free crust and Daiya vegan cheese. The gluten free crust was better than a usual gluten free crust., Very good GF pizza crust. You have to order at least a 10' one, but it is enough for two people. The sauce is pretty delicious. The service was great, I would definitely go back!, I liked it alot. Expensive for delivery. Tasted like real pizza, for a change. I'd order again, when I can spend $30 a pizza, lol, but that's SF. Still not 5 stars though. I'm still dreaming of finding a great gf pizza here in SF., Pretty good gluten free pizza and chicken wings! The menu is labeled with gluten free choices. The gluten free pizza doesn't heat up very well though it's great day of., Don't be duped by GF pizza - it's so good, but they don't use a separate oven or utensils. Definitely felt the effects of cross-contamination., Couldn’t eat here as it uses the same ingredients from the same line as the normal pizzas., delicious GF pizzas!!!! cocktails w/ GF spirits!!! Brazilian Herbie is very kindly and Happy!!! enjoy it a lot!!!, Best GF pizza crust I have had so far. Made in house, not a frozen tatsteless cracker., Celiac here. They have a great GF pizza with super fresh ingredients. Friendly staff as well, which matters to me. Never felt bad after eating., The gluten-free crust tastes like the standard one you get in many restaurants, but Paxti's cooks it up right - it's just crispy enough. The toppings are tasty and fresh, and the tangy tomato sauce is the best part. I hope someone creates a good gf deep dish crust, because the deep dish here looks amazing., Really good pizza, and they don't upcharge for gluten free crust or vegan cheese!, Good pizza. Slow service. Not much else gluten free., If I could give a zero star rating, I would. Despite reassurances that they could flag as an ""allergy"", change gloves, clean surfaces etc, they carried the GF crust in on top of a flour bin, put the pizza directly in the floury oven, used same cutter, etc. when questioned, the manager said ""yeah, well it's not a GF environment."" Avoid like the plague if you have celiac disease or NCGS., Eat here twice a month at least and have never been sick. Please tell them it is an allergy so that they will take special care, but they have always been great. ... I don't know who ever called it a ""$"", a pizza here is like $32 for one big enough to share., We go here often. The gluten free pizza is my favorite anywhere, and is also egg free. One of our favorite places to eat out, period, If you are celiac beware as I don't think they separate the pizza prep in the kitchen. I've tried it a few times hoping something will change, and have had a reaction every time., Great pizza. Friendly staff. Said they couldn't guarantee GF because they also had flour in the back. Very tasty crust., Delicious gluten free pizza! One happy celiac from Australia here
!!, best sauce outside of NYC and THE best gluten free crust I have ever had anywhere. regular crust is wonderful too. my husband raved about the peperoni.

Well guess what, they are not. Zorba's had the actual nutritional information on hand and shared it with me. I opted for the Athenian Salad with grilled chicken. Not only did my server suggest that I forgo the gyro (new information), pita (duh) and grape leaves, but she also knew that the dressing was GF too. My little GF had scrambled eggs, bacon and GF toast I watched them toast it in a completely separate toaster. It was all delicious and my salad was so huge, I had enough for a second meal.... The quantity and quality both exceeded my expecations., Our waiter was very educated about gf, and concern over cross contamination.
Large flavorful portions, cute patio area, must tables filled, service was prompt., Would give zero stars if I could. NOT gluten friendly by any stretch of the imagination. Our waitress was down right hostile.... I made her aware of my gluten issues, and she responded that the owner has celiac and EVERYTHING is cross contaminated. When I told her I had found the restaurant on this site, it went over her head. I asked what the GF options were, and she responded with ""well, what are you thinking?"" I listed the menu items that I thought might be safe, and her only response was ""No"". Apparently, according to her they even roll their falafel in bread crumbs before frying it. ... The other people with me ordered while I scoured the menu for something to eat. When she came back, I asked about the salads. I don't like oil and vinegar, and asked if the ranch was GF. She said ""it's a powdered mix, so probably not."" I asked about the Greek chicken on special, apparently that is rolled in bread crumbs too. I finally asked if there was anything that was actually GF. She got REALLY snotty then and said ""Let's go over the ENTIRE menu for you then"" She waved around at the breakfast stuff (which according to the menu isn't served past 10 am) and basically said I could have lettuce, olives, tomatoes, vinegar dressing and cottage cheese.... My husband finally lost it and told her we would pay for his side salad but we were leaving. When we stood up, the waitress said the kitchen had already started our meals. We told her to cancel them and she said ""fine"" and stormed off. We waited for a few minutes for the check for the side salad, but didn't see her again so we left. ... She then chased us OUT THE DOOR with the check, demanding that we pay it. My husband argued with her and she threatened to get the owner. My husband said he would LOVE to talk to the owner and she went back inside. We waited another 10 minutes, no owner. We left. ... Their listing on this site says they have bread etc. to substitute. NOT TRUE., Greek restaurant that provides breakfast, lunch and dinner. There is no separate GF menu, but the staff is very aware. I have eaten here dozens of times and so far only once there was cross-contamination (which is bad, of course). Still 5 stars for the many times they got it right.","GFMomma,Kathy,S Nimz,Mark",CO,1,1,4,80206

I did mention to them that the gluten-free cupcakes were on the bottom underneath the regular cupcakes so there is definitely the potential for some uncontaminated cupcakes to become contaminated once they are in the display case. The girl at the counter was so new she just didn't get it and when I mentioned it to a person who seemed to be in charge there she didn't seem to care. As she told me, "" it's not a gluten-free facility and there's always a chance of cross contamination. That's mentioned on our website. it only matters if you're Celiac"". Mmmm, OK..... That just tells me you don't understand the full depth of gluten sensitivity. therefore I would not be able to tell a Celiac they would feel safe in this place but those of us who are Gluten Sensitive may or may not notice anything from a Mermsid cupcake. I have Hashimoto's so I don't get any intestinal symptoms. ... So, I ate the cupcake. The texture wasn't very dense and a little bit firm but not dry. The frosting was very light and fluffy and not overly sweet which I thought was good. So all in all, I'd say it was a solid grade B /B+ GF cupcake. Not as good as my favorite (2Good2be) but definitely better than a lot of others I have tried. ... The main reason the Mermaids didn't get four stars from me was due to the attitude of the woman running the kitchen. even though she is making GF cupcakes she seems to have little knowledge as to the depth of food sensitivities., Tasted great but not feeling so great. I suspect cross contamination, cross contamination! Everything is made in same kitchen as wheat cupcakes., line up of Gluten Free cake and cupcakes ... Salty caramel cupcake was good and moist. A little spongy but awesome to have a safe gf cupcake. I'll be back!, Best gf cupcakes in town, hands down, Amazing amazing amazing!! Delicious cupcakes - fresh and they offer variety! It is not a dedicated facility but they have an impressive cross contamination process (you can read about it on their site). Seriously one of the best cupcakes I've ever had - including those before I was diagnosed celiac. Go - it's awesome!!!, Deliciously not too sweet cupcake!!! I'm
From New York and have had some of the best! This is excellent!!, I loved the cupcake, but I didn't really like the frosting. I had the chocolate carmel cupcake which was very sweet and tasty., I've ordered from Mermaids 3 or 4 times. While I'm thrilled that they have GF cupcake options I've always found their cupcakes to be a little dry., I have died and gone to gluten free heaven!!! Seriously delicious!!, Top notch gluten free cupcakes with tons of different flavor combinations., This place is amazing. So amazing, in fact, that we are having them do our wedding cakes, all gluten free. This will be the third time we've had them bake gluten free for parties, and we've never been happier with the results., Hands down the best chocolate cupcake I have had in years! It was just like my moms chocolate cake that I have been unable to eat since I was a kid! Thank you Mermaids thank you !! The coconut macaroons were incredible too!, They have a large selection of gluten free cupcakes. Most of them have buttercream frosting. If you call ahead they will put your order in a box for you.

Instead of taking ingredients out of the normal containers, the worker went into the back and used entirely new batches of the different ingredients. Most of their dressings are GF!, My visit was in March 2016 -- the employee I worked with seemed well-trained in cross-contamination issues, and the salad I had was simple but tasty and safe., I had trusted Mad Greens in the past. Yesterday I was told by the Mad Greens employee at different location that there is no chance of me eating there without getting sick. ""We make no guarantees regarding gluten because there are no controls in our food prep. We use the same cutting boards and knives to cut bread and vegetables without washing in between. Even if that cutting board was washed, we work side-by-side with gluten containing ingredients. All vegetables have probably been exposed to gluten, even those in the bins that have not been put on the line yet. It would be safer if you don't eat here."" So, I walked out. I do not understand how anything can say gluten free if there are no controls. That employee scared me out of the restaurant. I called corporate and they have not returned my call., I asked if their gluten free items were safe for someone with a gluten allergy and he said he didn't know, but probably wouldn't risk it. I ended up getting a make your own salad anyway. They use clean utensils and a clean bowl. it was alright, but i ate very simply, since i was worried about cross contamination., I love going to MAD Greens! They always have a wonderful selection of soups and salads that are safe! Try the Tarragon Vinigarette!!, Great healthy choices. Clearly labeled gf, Great place to eat GF. GF items are listed., They have a great allergy list, but not careful about cross contamination.... I ordered online and specifically told them gluten free- pretty good tasting salad but most of the way through eating, i found a gluten crouton in my salad.., Menu very clear on allergens... So yummy! Lots of great gf options., Great place to eat and was very knowledgeable with what was gluten free and what wasn't., I ordered a gluten free (marked) salad. Half way through my salad, I found a crouton in my food! I complained to them and they were very understanding and made me a new one. I watched them very carefully the second time around. I will say, some areas where they have the food were a little messy and I could see how cross-contamination can occur pretty easily here. Unfortunately, within a couple of hours I felt quite sick. I will not be back., Great salad and bowls with so many gluten free options. Delicious!!!!, AMAZING! I come here routinely. They have a wide selection of gluten free bowls and salads. Very very good!, I am Celiac and eat here frequently! Never have had any issues with being glutened. They are clean, and will take every precaution., Staff is helpful and menu is clearly marked with gf items. There are only a few items in the menu that are not gf. The food is fresh and they will adjust the order if you ask them to do so. Very good place!, I am very sensitive and have never gotten sick here. Their menu is pretty easy to navigate, but they also have an excellent interactive menu on their website. You can choose your dietary restrictions (gluten free, dairy free, etc.) and it will show you exactly what works for you. We have also found the staff to be knowledgeable and their prep procedure to be pretty safe at avoiding cross contamination. They make the food in front of you (think Subway or Chipotle style) and you can easily add or subtract items from the dishes, or create your own. They use a clean metal bowl to assemble the salads for each customer and there is an individual scoop in each ingredient. It’s one of those rare places where I feel like I can order like a “normal” person and don’t have to ask them a million questions to avoid being miserable later., Tell them you have a gluten allergy when you start going through the line and a single person will put your salad together and make sure nothing with gluten goes in., Almost everything is gluten free. However steak and some dressings are not. I usually do a build your own bowl. They have a list of which dressings are gluten free right on the glass where they make the bowls. I’ve been to this location 5 or 6 times and never have gotten sick., They have a nice selection of vegetables and protien. We were able to create our own salads and avoid gluten and dairy products. They do not offer gluten free bread., The staff seemed to be knowledgeable but I still became very ill after eating here., We have eaten here 3 times and every time has been delicious! Everything is fresh and high quality. Place was clean. I highly recommend it for your next Salad., They assured me all salads were gluten free. After I got sick I looked up the salad I had and sure enough the dressing and meat marinade had gluten. Not going back, Lots of options and had an board hung up for customers to see what contained gluten and other allergens, Got sick two times in a row after having one of the GF bowls., Great--I eat here weekly and the staff is educated about cross contamination., I have celiac disease. They use a clean bowl everytume they make a salad, and the person making my salad washed her hands without me even asking. You can look on their website on their allergy menu and choose no gluten and it will tell you what you can eat. I had the Pomona salad and it was really tasty. I had no issues at all., Many choices gluten-free. Staff very knowledgeable. Great salads., Ordered a salad and found a pasta piece. Don't bother, I have eaten here many times and never had a gluten contamination! I love MAD greens!, Good salads. Possibility of cross contamination, but I had no problems., GF soup was delicious! My salad was good too., They have a whole allergy selection online and things are labeled GF on the menu, Delicious, fresh, flavorful, healthy options and friendly staff., Delicious! Rated no on celiac friendly because of shared kitchen. I've only ordered salads so far but I am celiac and haven't had any issues., This place is AMAZING! Lots of made from scratch gf dressings. Citrus chicken is to die for. I have celiac with a very high allergy & have NOT gotten sick from any MADGreens locations on the east side. I eat here a couple times a week!, This is a good place for gluten free & Lactose free salads., Gluten info was clearly posted. The staff was knowledgeable about what was gluten free, even when it was not posted., salad and fresh juice. the juice is made of fresh ingredients and nothing in a bottle. the cups they use are recycled plant material. Great salads!!, Great salads with plenty of options. Dressings are clearly labeled . (Would suggest the red pepper one) ... In regards to the previous review, there aren't very many gluten ingredients to have cross contamination. Obviously it's possible, but unless you are hyper sensitive, you should be fine. (Do any restaurants really ""guarantee"" you won't have issues?) My sister and I (both celiacs) had no problems., Great salads with all allergens of all dressings clearly listed., I had trusted Mad Greens in the past.

Menu contains a great deal of options, a bit pricy, but no more than most of the areas offerings. Gluten free ravioli in Alfredo sauce is to die for. We came at an odd time, one of their ovens was down so unfortunately no gluten free bread for us, but it’s a comfort to know they have it. Other potential dishes include seafood based Mac and cheese, pizza, many soup/salad offerings etc., Awful, mushy GF pasta. The marinara was decent, but I would never come back here considering most GF friendly Italian restaurants actually provide al dente GF pasta that tastes pretty close to the real thing., Overpriced and the place is always packed., No gluten free bread but the gf pasta was tasty!, Yucky food that I wouldn't eat before or after GF diagnosis. :P, No gluten free menu but that staff is very knowledge about what on the menu can be substituted with the GF pasta to make it GF, Great gluten free pizza!... Good size portions! Open late, When I asked to speak with someone who could help me, someone came out right away and say they use the same oven for pizza (which I can’t eat anyways bc dairy) but they do clean the oven before they use it each time! And they have separate pasta that is gf!... They have a separate gf menu that is awesome! Most of the same things from the main menu but made gf. I got the margarita pasta and it was delicious! I am a super sensitive celiac and it didn’t make me sick at all! Just make sure you let them know you have celiacs before you order, The pasta was not only very bad, but I also got super sick after eating here. Please do not eat here if you are a celiac, I was in a bind for food and regretted it immediately., Pasta was just okay but don’t pay the extra fee for the garlic bread. It lacked flavor. Wouldn’t come again., I found a piece of what I think was normal pasta in my dish. Felt sick later., The staff is very aware of what celiac is. The waiter wore gives when he brought my food out. I had the ravioli and it was delicious. Did not get sick., The staff were knowledgable and when asked also stated pizza cooked in a separate oven, so could eat relaxed, and had no problems- highly recommended, in good agreement with earlier reviews - enjoy! 2x visits....., Disappointed to be writing this after all the positive reviews but ordered a gluten free pizza from the Moab location and found a regular pasta noodle mixed into the toppings too late. Got sick. Would not recommend., During a recent VK in Moab, checked out Pasta Jay’s based on favorable reviews in this app. Ate here multiple times during our stay in Moab. All waitresses that served us were knowledgeable about celiacs. Their pesto is to die for!, Delicious food and very aware of the care needed for celiac. Very safe. Both the GF pasta and pizza were fantastic!, Good food. I had the Tortelline Bellittini and did not react (Which is ALWAYS a bonus - Woo Hoo!), Food was delicious and lots of GF options.

I had pasta and my husband had pizza, both were great!, Great food, gluten free pasta was cooked perfectly and the gluten free menu which has a lot of options. Very, very clean restaurant, every server was cleaning in between waiting on their tables. Our server wasn't the best (we waited a while to get water and our food came out and we had to ask for silverware and napkins and waited about 5 minutes until we asked another server that brought it) and then had to ask for the check. After watching the other servers I believe it was just ours that was possibly having an off day. Would definitely go back!, Actual GF menu - not just gluten friendly. They tell you right up front that the pasta will take awhile as it's made to order. The pizza is done with great safety measures which they shared without prompting. Rachael was just awesome and so was the pizza!!, I had an amazing gluten free pizza!!!, They have an extensive gluten free menu. The ""garlic bread"" is just like a pizza crust but it tasted okay. The waitress said they cook all the gf pasta is separate water and the GF pizzas up high away from flour. I was happy she knew what she was talking about. And seemed confident., They have a long gluten free menu and the food was delicious but I got sick afterwards, not sure what happened :/, Ate here two nights in a row, had to go back for night two, the food is amazing. Best gluten free menu I’ve seen so far, so many options. I wish we had this option in Ottawa, Canada!!, Went to Pasta Jay's for dinner. They have a separate GF menu. We had the balsamic Brussels sprouts as an appetizer, which was really good. I'm not keen on GF pasta, so I avoided those dinners. Instead I had the dinner salad with shrimp, which was pretty good. They also offer GF pizzas. I didn't get sick! I'd recommend this place., Plain pasta with Alfredo sauce was very bland, and I would pass on the GF flat bread - it’s just the GF pizza crust and very plain. If I came again I would recommend paying a few dollars more for better tasting food. However they were very knowledgeable about Celiac and I did not get sick., The staff knew what they were dealing with. They have a separate oven for gluten free people and a separate and might i add large selection of gluten free items to choose from. The food was phenomenal !, The staff was so knowledgeable.... And the gluten free options were so delicious. We've been there twice so far, and my daughter (who has celiac) both loves the food and doesn't get sick!, Very very delicious. You will not regret coming to this place. The very best GF menu I have ever seen. Two whole page menu and you will not feel deprived at all. I had the ravioli and meat sauce. Top notch., This is the best place to go for GF pasta dishes. All kinds of choices and very delicious. Went back a second time to try more items. Totally recommend., They have a gluten free menu. Amazing food. We were seated at a ""high table"", and our view was of the kitchen, which was very interesting. The waiter was very good., Gluten free pasta available. Gluten free bread is basically pizza crust. No gluten free desserts., The gluten free pizza was delicious. Ask for the gluten free menu. It’s a separate menu. And, let the server know you want it gluten free. They have items on the standard menu with the same names., Staff was knowledgeable about what items they could adjust to different needs other then gluten, supporting the fact that they are great with gluten free. They have a gluten free menu and I felt very safe eating here. Great food and cooks. I definantaly would recommend this place. They have a gluten free pizza crust and pasta, allowing a lot of options., Delicious GF pasta and pizza crust! They have a GF menu with very specific info., There were many gluten free options since they have gluten free pasta. Most of the sauces (pesto alfredo and marinara) were gluten free. The waiter was knowledgeable about gluten sensitivity. I had chicken and broccoli with alfredo sauce which I thought was excellent., Probably closer to a 3.5. Not an overly trained staff, but she had started just a little while ago. Son had GF pizza and enjoyed it. I had pasta with mushroom sauce. No reply choices for type of pasta, Limited options. Very slow and very pricy for what you get., knowledge staff. great service. good choices on gluten free items. They have a gluten free menu. I had the gluten free pasta with pesto sauce and I added chicken. so good. will come again., They can make gluten free penne. Be warned, however, it took them 55 minutes to cook it and serve it. It is freezing inside in the summer. All in all a more grueling ordeal than the morning hike through desert canyons., The gluten free pizza was okay, pricey for what I got. Thin and scanty toppings. Paradox Pizza was much better. Much better., Went here because it had multiple 5 star ratings and was extremely disappointed! Waited more than 45 minutes for food with one other table in the restaurant (it was mid-afternoon on a weekday), was given non-GF garlic bread to ""hold me over"" for free, when we got our food the GF pasta was stuck together and had not been stirred when cooking, other pasta meal was burnt, was given attitude when complained, also this place was more expensive than I expected, about $15 a person for lunch, I had the pasta with marinara and chicken, super yummy, and portions are on the large side. very full happy tummy that was ready for White Rim trail the next day!, Call ahead to make sure they have GF pasta (they ran out on a busy day). The GF pizza was good. The stuffed chicken was great without pasta., My husband ordered the chicken fettucine alfredo, which comes with penne noodles if you're gluten-free. The noodles were cooked to perfection, and the sauce was absolutely delicious.... I ordered the gluten-free pizza with sausage and roasted bell peppers, which was delicious too. ... The portion sizes were on the bigger side, so next time we'll probably split a dish, but we went away with happy tummies and leftovers for later!, Great gluten free pasta!, Nice! Woke up feeling good, no cross contamination. The food was great, ate out on the patio. The pasta was yummy! Highly recommended., Probably the BEST GF pasta dish I've ever had.. And I've had a lot. The GF pasta is penne and they really cook it to perfection. I recommend the a la Genovese. The marinara is a little spicy. They also have GF pizza crust., Serves corn based pasta. The marina and alfredo are both gf. The sauce was a little spicy for kids.","Olivia,User,User,Evan,Merivel,Diego,Jaime,Mallory,Conor,Kelsey,Abraham,smiddy,David,Lane,Trisha,Lisa,powercharge,Laura,Sarah,Jenny,Betty,Dana,Janet,Lisa,Em,Audrey,Cscloutier,Leah,Kelsey,abigail,Penelope,Roger,Leisa,Max,julie fischer,girl,Trey,Jeanne,Victoria,ktouton,Camie,jolene,Pax,micheleK,User,Becky,Kevin,Pamela Sinclair,Ronny,janajana,Liz C,jd",CO,22,3,30,80302

Chips and burger patty. They use GF sliced bread for burger buns. Expensive for the food you get., I was originally told by the server that everyday except Wednesday was Celiac safe for french fries. (The fryer is used for fish and chips on Wednesday). After returning, and double checking before ordering, I was advised by two servers and a manager that the fryer is NOT separate and items with gluten are fried daily in the same fryer., I spoke at length with the server about whether or not the fries are safe, and I came to the conclusion that they are on every day but Wednesday. The restaurant changes the oil in the fryer daily, and they only fry gluten containing items on Wednesday. I've eaten the fries twice with no issues. ... The menu is very interesting and tasty for bar food, and they always have cider and gluten free beer. The servers are super friendly and the atmosphere is great., Went here based on other great reviews and didn't have the same experience. I was told I couldn't eat the fries and that they would do their best but couldn't guarantee anything. They have gluten free bread so I ended up getting a plain burger- no sides and I was fine. Great atmosphere but wouldn't recommend for someone who has celiac disease based on my experience. There are way too many other places in Boulder that are safe and have several options., Amazing food, amazing staff. I love that they always have cider available! I had a cider, plus an avocado veggie sandwich on gluten free bread with a side of French fries. It tasted delicious and didn't make me sick. The atmosphere here is wonderful too! It's definitely become a new favorite., I'm giving them three stars because they have a great GF hard cider, but I didn't like that I got my GF veggie burger with UDI's bread..not toasted..it was a sour disappointment and I didn't get my money's worth on the food., Very knowledgable waitstaff, really delicious food., Best Nachos in the world!","Casi,Rachel,julie,GFgirl,Jules,Julia,GF like the cool kids,Chris Frykman",CO,3,1,5,80302

First time I had been, I had been informed that this new location had dedicated gluten free fryers. AWESOME! On that first trip, I had FRIED CHICKEN!!!It was disappointing, kinda bland, but, still, I walked away happy, didn’t get sick and I’ve been jazzed to go back again soon. Finally made it back today. I was more than disappointed when I learned from the server during my “I have Celiac disease, can you feed me safely?” conversation, that they no longer have dedicated gluten free fryers. I was so bummed, but I was with my family and didn’t want to just not order, so I ordered the Knockoff burger with a gluten free bun and a side if beans, since I couldn’t have the fries.
Luckily I had my trusty Nima tester with me. I Tested the bun, burger and the side of beans.
The three minutes it took to test my meal felt like forever, but eventually the test finished. It was positive for gluten. I had the server take it away and asked to have the meal removed from the bill. She was very apologetic and said we wouldn’t be charged. A few minutes later the manager approached and asked about what was wrong with the meal I sent back. I explained the situation and he also was very apologetic. He asked for a chance to make me something else, but by then my family was almost done eating and we had plans, so no time to let them try again. The manager then offered me a gift certificate to come back and try again later. If it weren’t for my Nima, I would have said no thanks, I I have a one strike rule when it comes to gluten exposure at a restaurant, but with my Nima I can always verify the safety of my food. Sorry didn’t mean for this to turn into a Nima review, but it really makes me feel so safe and empowered!
Anyway, I’ll post an update when I go back and use that gift cert., Went because of the mirage promise of gluten free fried chicken only to hear the hated words ""oh I'm sorry it's gluten FRIENDLY if you have real allergies let me recommend ____"". 😢😢😢 even advertise gluten free chocolate cake that looked amazing in the case next to their ""regular carrot cake"". ... Hard to hate when the staff is so passionate & nice, but DO NOT promote this as gluten free when all of the precautions aren't being taken., That GF fried chicken is legit., Gluten Free Fried Chicken. Need I say more?, My absolute favorite. The food is excellent! Wings, fries, tacos, burgers. And I never get sick!, Staff was not knowledgeable and when I asked if the fries were safe and she said that they were not so I’m assuming they are not fried in a separate fryer in which case why label it as gluten free? If you’re eating gluten free by choice it could work but I would not recommend if you have celiac or any intolerance unless you want another salad., Not celiac friendly. Nima sensor detected gluten., I had a great experience at Punch Bowl Social and got to enjoy ‘bar food’ for the first time in years. It’s not a dedicated GF facility so there is a risk of cross contamination. I spoke to the chef prior to eating there (called in advance) and the chef said that they do take allergies/celiac disease very seriously and have protocols in place to do their best to avoid cross contamination. If you have celiac and visit this location, make sure to call in advance and also tell your server that you’re ordering gluten-free due to allergy., The food here is excellent! They have a dedicated fryer and almost anything can be made gluten free. The staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. They also have games, bowling, darts, and so many fun activities! Definitely would recommend coming here!, This place has one of the biggest gluten free menus I have ever seen. I ordered a burger and the gluten free bun didn’t taste gluten free at all. And the fries were so crispy and delicious. I didn’t even get slightly sick and I have celiac. Seriously amazing. And it’s fun. There’s bowling, ping pong, foosball, darts, karaoke, and board games. I would recommend to anyone with celiac. There’s also a huge amount of vegan and vegetarian options. There’s stuff for almost any dietary needs., Not safe for celiac everything is in a shared fryer, Went through a lengthy process to make sure it would be a GF meal only to be glutened., For years I have eaten at PBS, but recently each visit the options and service have been getting worse. They used to have a dedicated fryer, but that is no longer the case. All tortilla chips, fries, breakfast potatoes (standard breakfast) share a contaminated fryer. Despite many items being labeled gf in the menu, most are not celiac safe. Thankfully the manger and chef are aware of cross contamination concerns however the wait staff is not very knowledgeable. Last Sunday I went there for brunch and was made an non gluten free breakfast because the waitress forgot to log it into my order, despite stating my allergy multiple times. When my food arrived, I was very apprehensive of the bread (it looked too good to be gf) and asked the chef to confirm my meal was made gf. Thankfully I asked / trusted my senses and they completely remade my order. However when it came out, there were no potatoes ( just learned that visit that they are made the shared fryer) and ended up paying $10 for an egg, 2 pieces of bacon and toast (they did not offer to substitute the potato for a gf item). ... TL:DR If you are Celiac and plan to eat here, do not trust the menu /wait staff, and make sure you speak with a manager about your food prior to ordering to confirm what can actually be made gluten free and if something has to be removed, what it can be replaced with so you don't pay full price for only half a meal., I would be very careful eating here. The waitress put in my order gluten free for the crab Rangoon dip w/o wantons and sub corn chips. The kitchen staff brought it out and told me that wontons are gluten free (they are not gf) and they are fried in a gf separate fryer, and got mad when I questioned him. The waitress (amazing) came to the table, I checked with her and she said not this is not gluten free. She was wonderful talked to the chef and stopped my order. If you eat here please be careful., I wish I could give this place zero Stars. They have a million ""gluten-free options"" but the last time I ate there I violently vomited all night, I have to eat straight up gluten for that to happen. Usually I end up with a really bad stomach ache and other GI stuff, I literally violently vomited after eating here., A lot of options including gluten free bun and fries. The chef came out to talk to us, completely understood cross-contact and recommended against some things that were listed as gluten friendly on the menu due to our sensitivity. Burgers come out on skillets but due to absorption, our gluten free stuff came out on plates. Big burgers!, My girlfriend and I went here before a Braves game and we both got the Knockoff Burger and it was so delicious!! She said it was hands down the best gluten free bun she has ever eaten!! Most of their menu is gluten free and their rosemary fires were on point!, Ate here and didn't get sick. GF items marked on the menu. Dedicated fryer. had the burger with GF bun and fries. fun place. service kind of stinks though., Got sick after eating there the third time. Each time I ordered the fried chicken., Amazing! So happy with my meal. The server was extremely knowledgeable and the menu was easy to read and figure out. Will be going back at some point. Also fries are safe there!!! Just make sure to ask questions, Falafel sandwich (with bread!) was great and they have a dedicated fryer!, I was informed several weekends ago that they DO NOT have a dedicated GF fryer anymore, however the menu notations indicating GF have not been updated., After having to go to a few restaurants in the area, I ended up here for takeout. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The menu has tons of GF options and my salad was DELICIOUS. So fresh and flavorful. I’m not celiac but they seemed very knowledgeable and I trust my meal was GF., 2 words FRENCH FRIES!!!!! I’ve been here a few times for a night out with friends and both times I got their rosemary fries and they were AMAZING! They have a dedicated fryer and they are extremely knowledgable when it comes to celiac. I can’t wait to go back during the day and try other GF menu items!, My husband and I stopped in for an early snack and drink before heading to dinner. The lobster French fries are not on the menu anymore so we got the nachos. They were pretty good, but the service was terribly slow even with multiple servers coming to our table. I would give it another try, maybe we just hit a weird evening, The waitress was amazing about making sure our daughters food was prepared properly! She’s very sensitive and she loved the burger and the gf bun!!!!! Usually she opts no bun! Great atmosphere as well!!!, I ate here twice. The first time I got nachos and it was fine. The second time I ordered the tacos and was severely glutened.., ALERT!!!
Menu changed as of early 2019: no more dedicated fryer and all fried items get cross-contaminated, so ignore most of the (G) designations on the menu, as they no longer apply.... Ordered the Knockoff burger with GF bun. Waiter apologized not less than six times and steered me towards (wait for it...) a side salad without croutons instead of the previously GF fries. Bless the man, he did what he could with the train wreck scenario that management had left him. The chef also came out to check on me, which was very good of him.... I don’t think I got CC’d, it would have hit me by now, and the burger was hot and flavorful, so they get three stars for making the best of an untenable situation.... This feedback posted by JT, Celiac hubby of this jointly-owned app., Definitely not a kid/family friendly place. Hostess was super rude/aloof., Amazing!
Menu is clearly marked, dedicated fryer, educated staff.
When I did have questions beyond staffs knowledge they sent the head regional chef to our table.
Excited to eat here again., Was very excited to eat lunch here while in Cleveland. After finding the place found that they do not open until 4:00. I have eaten at the Detroit location and would give that location 5 stars., yummy gf food and they take allergies seriously, Good gluten free fried chicken!! I’ve never gotten sick. Just be prepared for slow service and a few mess ups with orders in the kitchen., They have a separate Gluten free menu. Their gluten free fried chicken is great and is cooked in a separate fryer! The server was very knowledgeable and the drinks are good too., I just arrived yesterday to Chicago and I went to that restaurant because I’m very celiac since I was worn. I ordered the gluten free wings and fries. They cooked everything in a separated place. The food was incredible and super safe!!, Heard good things so I gave this place a try. Had nachos from happy hour menu as an appetizer & fried chicken for my meal. Nachos were unbelievably good & chicken was decent (not crazy about side salad). I should have questioned things when person delivering my fried chicken said, “this should be gluten free”. Spoiler alert...it wasn’t!!
Such a disappointment considering all the amazing places in area I could have safely eaten. Go for games, but eat elsewhere!!, Love this place! Great for families to hang out and good food. Eaten here several times with no issues, Managers and staff were amazing! Kids were able to enjoy a gf grilled cheese (cooked on a separate pan) and gf fries cooked in a separate fryer! They have a gf menu and were very accommodating. Overall - it was an amazing experience!, it gets 5 starts for Gluten Freen Fried Chicken alone, but it has much more!, Excellent options like GF fried chicken and they have a dedicated fryer. Great place to go out with friends and not feel like the odd person out. Highly recommend., The staff was incredibly knowledgeable about gluten free and celiac concerns and they have a great gluten free menu (completely separate from the main menu).
All of their fryers are gluten free, so there’s absolutely no chance of cross contamination.
I *highly* recommend the fried chicken! It was the crispiest most delicious fried chicken I’ve ever had - even counting pre-celiac days.
The ambiance is fantastic. There are many options for entertainment offered at the rear, at incredibly reasonable hourly rates.
We’re only in Indy for the weekend, and have already been there twice! Great spot., Their ""OMFG GF Fried Chicken"" is out of this world amazing, and is truly, truly gluten free (celiac-safe.) I have no idea about the rest of the menu, I've never had reason to look at anything else. But you must go for the fried chicken!!! Also they have Lakefront New Grist beer. 1 happy celiac here., This place is so fun! Tons of games and things to do, plus the food is great. Lots of GF options and the staff is knowledgeable. I had the lobster fries and they are made in a dedicated frier. Make sure to tell them you want the GF option on your order., The staff was very helpful and nice, even the manager stoped to make sure everything was good. I got the fried chicken and it tased great. I will go back!, Gluten free fried chicken is great! It’s pan fried. They are great with celiac and I’ve been there many times. Try the tacos (corn tortillas), they are delicious too. Good experience, they have never made me sick, The food here is excellent and the wait staff very knowledgeable about Celiac and cross contamination. Lovely atmosphere is a bonus!, All GF options marked on menu. Lobster french fries. OMG. lots of options, friendly accomidating staff. Eaten here twice on busy Sat night and felt fine on both occasions. The fact I could order 2 appetizers with my friends and share was a nice change for me., Icons were available to state items were gluten free or could be made gluten free easily., I love this place, they have so many options! the staff is very nice to work with and answered all my questions., Be mindful that if you’re not in a group party it’s not open for you until 4pm even though it says 11am., Good food but TERRIBLE service. I've come here with every size party imaginable, and the service is awful every time, regardless if you're dining with 1 other or 15 others. When they finally bring your food out to you, it will be delicious, IF they don't accidentally put the croutons on that you asked them to leave off. ... I gave them so many chances, but fool me 10 times, shame on me., The ""knock-off"" burger is like a gourmet big mac, soooo good. Really unique sweet pickles and pickled red onions in it. There's also a Cuban sandwich that's so rich with buttered and grilled bread, stuffed with juicy pulled pork and just lavished in cheese. The E&J Banana Brandy alcoholic milkshake is GF. I've even contacted the distiller to confirm. The margaritas are from scratch, no mix so you're safe! I'm in love. They serve GLUTEN biscuits with everything so just ask if you can have bread (toast) instead. personally I suggest that you do not fill up on just the bread because the meal and the drink are worth the wait. Make sure you specify gluten free if you order anything because the wings in particular could end up in a different fryer if you don't., Great place with great food. Lots of GF options. Everything was really fresh. The staff is friendly. And the atmosphere is nice. I recommend the roasted carrot salad., I had a fantastic time here! They have so many gluten free options. I got the Sweet Cilantro Wings (no buttermilk dressing) and the Adobo Mushroom Tacos (no queso sauce or cheese). I definitely recommend trying both!!","Lora,tex,GFLisa,AK,Joelle,Sarah,Allison,Lisa,Rebecca,Jordan,Callie,Vanessa,Corissa,carrie,Amanda Hartpence,spaff,Ryan,Greg,AFD,kenzie,Jaime,Madison,GFBostonBurbs,Angela,Nicol,Jodi,adam,M & Jt,Meghan,Lindsay,Judy B,C,Pamela,clo,Espe,Dawn,sheldon,spatel ,Justin M.,glutenfreesacramento,Bekah,ChenPing,Alysa Bajenaru,Steve wojda,Judy,Cg,Eileen,Lauren,Karly,NCGS,Devon,Jessica Nicole,SumDC,Lauren",CO,22,12,40,80203

So now I’ll sit here and starve while I watch my family eat., We came here from out of town. Service was sub par, and the gluten free pancakes tasted like cardboard and were so dry I had to use so much syrup to get them so they were soft. They advertised berry pancakes and the dish came cold and had a few berries on top. Service was ok at first then the waitress never came back to check on us. Save ur time and go to Snooze. They had amazing GF options., There are good options but if you have celiac do not order the gluten free toast. They put it in the sam toaster as other bread., Lots of GF substitutes... English muffin, pancakes, fruit, etc. Sadly the smashed tots are cooked in designated fryer so chance of cross contamination. Loved my omelet and GF English muffin! Service was amazing, too!, We lucked out and our waitress also had Celiac, so she was well versed on options. Had a spinach and fresh mozzarella omelette and it was lovely. Try the crack bacon!!, It had a few options. It was delicious but I am not sure there wasn't some sort of cross contamination. I have felt sick most of the day. Too bad because it is a really nice little place to visit., A little bummed they cooked their gf pancakes and other items on the same griddle., I ordered the ""classic"" bacon and egg breakfast with a GF pancake and clearly stated that I have Celiac Disease. The waitress acted like she didn't really care. From the texture of the pancake served I am fairly sure it was constructed of GF materials, but I had a reaction within an hour after eating there. Seems there must be a lot of cross contamination in the kitchen and the menu does clearly state that the establishment will not guarantee its gluten free items. ... Fine if you're on a GF diet for non-medical health reasons - AVOID if you have Celiac's., We visited Syrup every visit to Denver and have recommended them many times, but I did want to warn my fellow Celiacs that when I visited last week, I got very sick. I ordered the eggs Benedict with a gf English muffin and clearly it wasn't. Either that or there was quite a bit of cross contamination. They usually do a great job, but they aren't flawless. Mistakes still happen. I would just recommend really stressing how important it is that they serve you gluten-free food., FANTASTIC and then some. would have given 5 but had to wait 40 minutes, wonderful pancakes, wonderful bloody Mary's., The bananas foster pancakes were wonderful! I recommend adding the pecan butter! I have Celiac's and had no reaction to the food. I'll be back!, I am surprised to see the "" be very cautious"" reviews. I tried Syryps downtown location for the first time and found the staff to be extremely careful to not allow any gluten whatsoever, the food was extrodinary, I tipped my waitress and the kitchen personell. I look forward to going back. Thank you, syryps, ,it was the first time I got to go out to eat since my diagnosis., they offer a gluten free menu but do not take any steps to prevent cross contamination. when I told the waitress I was allergic to wheat she said they were busy and cook everything on the same grill. I asked if they could clean the grill and she said no they were too busy. ... I would not recommend this place if you have an intolerance or allergy!, A rare treat for the gluten intolerant! I am unsure if they cross contaminate, but for me it doesn't matter. Outstanding waffles, service, atmosphere. Kid friendly too!, gluten free options are awesome, waffles, pancakes AND french toast for that carb fix :) however their ""syrup"" options are not real, they are the general high fructose corn syrup options with flavorings. had to check just to be sure. great find, would eat again just make sure to ask for real maple when ordering., Be VERY careful with what you order here. They have a pretty darn extensive GF menu. However, they aren’t doing anything right when it comes to gluten-free. If you just want to eat sans gluten as a trend, or a fad – cool, then go here and have amazing food. However, if you are sensitive, you need to question their kitchen practices. I was excited to see about the pancakes, they sounded amazing. But I was more excited when I saw the english muffins because I’m a sucker for breakfast sandwiches. And then I made a mistake – I asked them how it was prepared.... They toast the muffins in the same toaster as gluten bread.... They make the waffles in the same waffle maker as the gluten waffles.... They make the pancakes on the same griddle as the gluten ones.... Be very very careful here if you are a celiac!

Very tasty... reviewed too soon I guess. Sick as heck. Some kind of significant cross contamination. Sadness. I loved this place. ... Returned another time, had no problems on the second visit. So, this place is hit and miss for celiacs., I am celiac and have ordered gluten free pizza from here. I know gluten free dough is hard but theirs get really hard quickly. I can't say if they have a dedicated space for gluten free pizza. The toppings we're good but didn't love the crust., Have eaten here several times and never got sick. Pizza delicious and non-GF really like their deep dish. Very knowledgeable and accommodating., Great pizza. No issues. Ordered online, GF pizza was yummy. I highly recommend the artichoke dip. They offered gf bread to go along with the appetizer(which was just a plain pizza crust). We ordered appetizer and 14” gf pizza. Plenty for two people and left overs. Would definitely visit again., Patxi’s Pizza has gf thin crust. Knowledgeable servers reviewed the process and assured us it’s safe (with usual caveats about not being a gluten free kitchen). We had vegan gf thin crust cheese and gf vegan classic veggie thin crust. Tested crust and sauce with Nima tester and it passed. Pizza tastes great too., I know someone who works here and they told me the gluten free pizzas do not have a separate space. They share the same spot in the oven cooking with the other regular pizzas. Wouldn’t recommend if you are celiac or have a severe gluten allergy, Started of promisingly but my Coeliac wife was served a regular Gluten containing base after ordering GF and telling the server she was Coeliac. If you do eat here double check when your pizza comes out!, I do not recommend this location. I asked several questions, and was not satisfied with their answers. The 3 people I talked to didn't know what celiac was, and they use the same cutter for GF and regular pizzas. They said they wipe it off in between with a rag, but when they held up the rag, it was covered in flour., Server was super helpful and they have a lot of gf options. He said the pizzas are pre-packaged and they prepare them separately. No complaints from me!, Best gluten free pizza I have found. Tastes more like they make it themselves. A lot of pizza places obviously buy the same crusts from somewhere that are..meh. Now if Patxi’s can only make their deep dish GF.... sigh, I can dream., GF pizza was great. servers seemed stressed and overworked, but most were doing their best. Probably do take out., Great gf pizza and caesar no croutons with anchovies. The bottom of the crust looks like the closest thing to glutened pizza I've seen and it is light, not too chewy and the end bits are tasty. It's a beer and wine place but they have Angry Orchard, so life could be worse. ... Keep in mind that you are in San Francisco and things. just. move. more. slowly. here. I asked for a small ramikan of marinara with my pizza. It took 22 minutes to reach me. If I wanted it cold I could have gotten it after about 10 minutes. Apparently, they dont have a large pot of the bubbling goodness in the back. So. Ok. But 22 mins? Not sure why it was that hard and certainly a reasonable ask given it's a pizza joint. That said, the pizza is really good if you are seeking gf pizza in SFO. Def in my top 3 thus far.... The ambiance is laid back and neighborhoody. This is not on a main drag. Come along or with a party. It is a family-friendly establishment., I called ahead and found out they buy their GF crust pre-made (so its not made in the kitchen with the rest of the gluten pizza) The GF pizza I got was excellent, and I didn’t get sick from eating there., The gf pizza is delicious! The homemade crust was crunchy and tasted great! I have celiac and have been here several times now with no problems. Gluten free options are clearly marked on the menu and the wait staff is very knowledgeable., I ate here and got sick after and i know someone who works here and said the staff does not care about allergies, Great food and service! They have a dedicated gluten free kitchen and had plenty of vegan options! Staff was knowledgeable!, Love Patxis! Delicious gluten-free pizza - now offered in two sizes - and they’ll even serve the artichoke dip with gluten-free pizza crust if requested (to substitute the crostinis). They also have Angry Orchard Cider. Love their food, friendly and prompt service and great place for lunch, dinner or to catch a sports game., delicious glutenfree pizza with various option, A bit over priced but it's an option, gf pizza is literally the only gluten-free options they have. I've had better at another pizza place in town and the cost was less., The staff had great knowledge of what is gluten free. What I loved most is that my husband is allergic to dairy and they had dairy free cheese. It’s been a long time since he was able to have cheese on a pizza., Had a slice of gf pizza delivered to a birthday party. Cherry tomato and spinach pizza was delicious (even when a little cold) and I didn’t get sick! Next time I’ll eat more slices!!, Paxti's actually takes care now to say that they do not prevent cross-contamination. I used to be able to eat here without noticable side effects, but the last two times I became incredibly sick. However, I have increasingly become more sensitive to low amounts of gluten. I wouldn't risk it anymore and would encourage anyone who gets severe symptoms to stay away., Had their GF pizza a few times while visiting San Jose - good pizza, and safely gluten free., Pizza was so good!! Friends that aren’t GF still ate it and could tell the difference in texture. Did not get sick., Ordered 2, 10 inch gluten free pizzas. One pepperoni and the spinach pizza. Both tasted fine. Wait time wasn’t too long., The BEST gf pizza and toppings. Dairy free Daiya vegan cheese an option too. Excellent salads., Pizza was great! The waitress told me the gf pizza is cooked on a separate rack from the ""normal"" pizzas. They can't guarantee no cross-contamination, but basically no restaurant wants to unless they're dedicated gf anyway., Beautifully delicious thin GF pizza, knowledgeable staff., Loved this place! The service was excellent - my daughter forgot to mention that she needed her pizza to be GF and our server could not have been nicer about it. The GF thin crust was the best I've had. Great food, great service, great vibe! Don't miss it!, This is one of the Patxi's locations that has gluten-free options (including an awesome GF pizza crust.) GF options are called out on the menu, but you can also make some things safe with minor alterations (no crutons on salads, ask to get the bread on the Burrata appetizer replaced with a GF pizza crust, etc.) Be aware that the sausage contains wheat but the rest of the meats are fine., Vey good food and kind, responsive service. They offer gluten free, dairy free crust and Daiya vegan cheese. The gluten free crust was better than a usual gluten free crust., Very good GF pizza crust. You have to order at least a 10' one, but it is enough for two people. The sauce is pretty delicious. The service was great, I would definitely go back!, I liked it alot. Expensive for delivery.

They have a great GF pizza with super fresh ingredients. Friendly staff as well, which matters to me. Never felt bad after eating., The gluten-free crust tastes like the standard one you get in many restaurants, but Paxti's cooks it up right - it's just crispy enough. The toppings are tasty and fresh, and the tangy tomato sauce is the best part. I hope someone creates a good gf deep dish crust, because the deep dish here looks amazing., Really good pizza, and they don't upcharge for gluten free crust or vegan cheese!, Good pizza. Slow service. Not much else gluten free., If I could give a zero star rating, I would.

Avoid like the plague if you have celiac disease or NCGS., Eat here twice a month at least and have never been sick. Please tell them it is an allergy so that they will take special care, but they have always been great. ... I don't know who ever called it a ""$"", a pizza here is like $32 for one big enough to share., We go here often. The gluten free pizza is my favorite anywhere, and is also egg free.

They do not have a dedicated fryer for the corn chips - they were AWESOME though and offered to make me a kale salad with chicken which while it was not what I wanted, it was pretty good! I have not tried the other locations - so they may have more offerings! So glad the manager was knowledgeable!, Went there for lunch today and asked about the gluten free options.

Good salads too., I had to have it twice in one day! I can't disagree enough with the ""... "" comparison. They may not be an artisan establishment, the pizza is made fresh and sliding off the crust hot :-) It's unlike other gf crust I've had. Like a thin crust, with a slight chew, I really liked it. The salami was delicious chunks, rather than thin slices. The veggies are sliced nice and thin, not so thin they char though. Can't speak to cross-contamination, I didn't ask at either location. Though I'm fairly sensitive and had no reaction either time., Very respectable gluten free thin crust pizza., We carry Sweet Escapes GF pizza crust (the best we've ever had). We are not a gluten-free facility, but we do take extra care when baking this crust and put it on it's own piece of parchment paper to avoid any cross contamination.

I’m a 15 year celiac and this pizza was SO so so good!!, The staff was great, the pizza delicious, and safe to eat!, I love their tapioca-based GF crust.

She has yet to have an issue after eating here., Great pizza! CC precautions taken, and everyone seemed knowledgeable about celiac. I'm very sensitive, but no reaction was hard., Their GF pizza is yummy, and they deliver!, Excellent GF pizza! If you are Celiac, explain to the staff.

They no longer have GF chips bc they got rid of their dedicated fryer, but the tacos and margaritas are soooo worth the stop!, This is a chain restaurant from Colorado. They own the pizza place next door. Their food is primarily made with previously frozen ingredients. Super heavy on the soy and salt., Good food, gf marked right on the menu, friendly knowledgeable staff., Eaten here several times - always enjoy the huge selection of interesting tacos, and I always feel great after eating here!, We had a very nice lunch here summer of 2016. Our service was great. The waiter was careful to explain how cross-contamination might occur, and even went back and spoke with the chef about what procedures are in place to prevent it. I have looked at the other reviews and agree there is not a large selection available for GF. However, most of the tacos can be had and the tacos, rice and beans were delicious.

The first time I went, I explained the celiac issue & they served me with corn tortillas. I did not get sick. However, the next time I went back and tried to order corn tortillas, the waiter said that they would not be safe due to being cooked on the same surface as the flour tortillas, and suggested lettuce wraps instead.

Would come back again!, They were able to cook the food in the back so that we avoided cross contamination. The service was nice and knowledgeable. But all of my party got food poisoning. The meat was uncooked and disgusting. It is safe in terms of gluten but not in general. It is a very cool place and they cook your food in front of you but beware of the risk., I marked Celiac friendly because they handle ‘allergies’ well by cooking in the back with a clean pan. But picking ingredients is buffet style. The main problem is from sauces dripping into the gluten free sauces. But you don’t have to pick a sauce. There are dry spices that can be added for extra flavor. ... That said we arrived before the dinner rush and I tried the two gluten free sauces as the area looked completely clean. But by my third bowl sauces had been dropped everywhere so I didn’t have a sauce but picked some spices. Still good but much better with sauce.... Food was really good and it’s all you can eat., Front desk & wait staff very knowledgeable about gluten free needs. Clearly marked ingredients and sauces that are gluten free.

Separate kitchen for cooking. Lots of information on their products., I go here all the time and have never been glutened! They have a separate cook space for people with allergies., This place is horrible! You would think for being a place that offers so many gluten-free options that it would be really good but it isn't. They have a separate allergy section for people who have food allergies where they cook food in a small pan. They can only cook two at a time so it takes forever to get your food and the staff is extremely rude. Anytime you talk to anyone on the staff they treat you like you are dirt. The food and itself when you order carryout seems to be cross-contaminated and they don't even put in what you order. The last time we got carry out from this place they filled the box with 90% rice to cover up the fact that they didn't put anything else in the bowl. The bowl in itself tasted like chlorine and the staff was extremely rude. A short time earlier we took my mom there for her birthday and one of the waiters That was supposed to wait on us said he didn't want our table and pushed us off on somebody else because he wanted to sit at the bar and talk to his friends. On that same experience we had three people who had allergies and because they only cook 2 at a time in a small frying pan it probably about 40 minutes to get our food and those without food allergies had cold food by the time we were all seated at the table. Our waiter very seldom came to check on us and had an attitude. Everyone they have as a Hostess it seems is rude, arrogant and clearly doesn't want to be there. This used to be a really great place but with the staff being so rude and lazy it's just gone down really bad. I wouldn't recommend it., I really like this place, but the last time I was there I got glutened somehow. I did the separate grill and gf ingredients, so
I’m not sure what happened. I will give them another try but be cautious., They label gluten free and they cook food in a completely different area. You may have to ask for some non-contaminated food from the buffet (noodles are right next to some other food), but they have always been very helpful. Food is delicious., I loved this place! The staff is very friendly and encouraged me that my food was safe. And it was! My only complaint is that there isn’t a huge selection of sauces. I also loved that they have an allergy station!, great service, clean but NOT celiac friendly. They cooked my food separately in the back and gave me sauces from the back but I got terribly ill anyway. :(, I like the Canton location much better as they have a separate cooking station visible inthe main room. I didn't know this location had a separate station in the back. I was nervous I would be sick as I had them cook on the regular grill., Love this place. Have gone a dozen times and never had an issue. They have a dedicated cooking space with separate pans for allergy cooking, where they ask what your allergies are and ask if olive oil is ok to cook your food with. The sauces are labeled if they are gluten free/vegetarian. They will ask if you want tortillas, white rice, brown rice, and/or lettuce wraps brought to the table. I get the rice and the lettuce wraps. I believe their soy sauce on the table is gluten free, I can't remember as I don't eat soy. Included in your meal price is the soup/salad bar, and last time i visited both soups were labeled gluten free, and delicious. The meal can seem pricey but it includes a lot of food if you fill up your stir fry bowl, and eat the salad and soup. I always come home with leftovers for at least a whole meal., always great food and service. definitely need to be careful about what foods you choose because there's a risk of cross contamination but as long as you avoid noodles, imitation crab, and any of the surrounding foods to those options (because stuff drops out) then you're golden. they'll cook it in a separate fryer in the back too., Got sick shortly after eating here, Everything is label that is gluten free. They do have gluten free noodles. Makes sure you tell them at the grill you have a gluten allergy and they will clean the grill and put dividers up for your food. I have ate here many times and never had an issue., Not dedicated gluten free and there is always to possibility of cross contamination of ingredients at the ingredient bar, but they have fresh meats and vegetables and several GF sauce options. You can tell your server or the grill cook you cannot have gluten and they will cook your food in a clean wok in the kitchen. I have eaten here and at the Toledo and Ann Arbor locations and have not been glutened., This is cross contamination city. You WILL get glutened here because of the way the food is stored. Teriyaki with gluten right next to it gluten free sauce. BEWARE!!!, can eat here safely have them grill it in the back., They are not careful what so ever for gluten intolerant or Celiac disease. I have Celiac and i did not want to chance it. Cross contamination is going to happen or has happen for others. A depressing place for gluten intolerant and celiac disease population., Very helpful staff, and celiac friendly. They prepare allergy bowls on a completely separate cooking surface in the back, not on the main grill. Good selection of meats and vegetables to choose from.... Two things that keep me from giving them a 5-star. First, very limited selection of GF sauces, and the GF sauces they did have were somewhat unusual. None of them were made with GF soy sauce as far as I could tell. Second, they couldn't tell me which of the seasonings (spices/salts/peppers/etc.) were GF, so I didn't use any of them. Because of these two issues, my bowls came out tasting pretty bland. But BD's might be right up your alley if you're GF and don't like spicy food., Celiac friendly but not a ton of options when it comes to sauces., Super nice staff! They will cook your food separately! If you are just sensitive like I am they will give you the option to cook it in back or they will clean the grill very well and put in dividers. I went for the grill and watched them the whole time. They were very careful even using separate utensils!, This place is a disaster waiting to happen. Actually eating there was a disaster. Cross contamination galore. The gluten free sauces are next to and/or in front of non-gf sauces. So who knows what was dropped in each sauce!!?? The salad bar was the same. Croutons by the lettuce and other fresh veggies. The soup, which is included with the meal along with the salad, was not gluten free. The place was disorganized and chaotic, but it was a Saturday night. I'm doubled over in pain now. If you go BEWARE., I was a bit skeptical of the whole thing when I first arrived. But after talking to the chef in the allergy area, I felt pretty comfortable with the separate cooking area. The buffet prep area gets pretty hectic and sloppy, so that could be an issue., Nasty, dirty, dedicated allergy area absolutely not even if the sign above the area says so, the considerations for cross contamination are no where to be found at the buffet area or cooking area. My husband and I ending up with the worse headaches 1 hour after we left and my digestion system hasn't recovered yet and it's been weeks. I will never ever eat there again and I warn everyone even those with no allergies to stay away just because of the filth. Need proof take a stroll through there. Can't believe this place isn't on a health inspectors list., Dedicated allergy cooking center. Soups that day were not GF. They have four sauces that are GF. No appetizers but the salad was largely ok. They do sell GF cider. Overall a good safe choice and I will be coming back., Yummilicious!! A complete allergy cooking station? Wow., One grill is used for all food but there is a gluten free sauce list along with allergy free cooking and vegetarian options, This is an excellent restaurant that is very allergy friendly. It's a ""fix it yourself"" kind of buffet where you can pick different things to throw into a stir-fry. All you have to do is tell your server that you have an allergy and they will give you an allergy ticket. They have some gluten free sauces up there and all you have to do is read the stickers. When you get all of your food, you go up to the grill and hand them your food, sauce, and especially the allergy ticket. Then they will take it in the back and cook it for you so that you don't have to worry about cross contamination with the foods on the front grill. I don't know for sure if it's Celiac friendly or not, but they take food allergies or special diets very seriously there, so I would ask., Had delicious chicken, rice noodles, and veggies in a lemon sauce! They got all my ingredients from the back to avoid cross-contamination and made it in the Allergy Zone, a separate kitchen space for cooking allergy dishes. Will def come back!, Very helpful and friendly. They have an allergy zone for allergies and food is cooked separately. We let the manager Matt know of the allergy when we came in. They let us pick out the meats, sauces and spices we wanted first and then got everything fresh from the back to avoid cross contamination. Rice noodles were cooked well. Create your own gf Mongolian dish! Gf beers and drinks too., So much cross contamination we left!! Staff wasn't knowledgable about gf options and didn't Have anyone to ask!!!, Sauces marked as gluten-free. Will cook food separate to not cross contaminate. Very accommodating., Says GF, but it's not. Lots of cross contamination. Messy meat and veggie bars, menus and table tents had sauce left on them from previous diners. over from, My mom is gluten free an when we come to Mongo all she has to so is say she is gluten free and they take her bowl back to an allergy grill. She has never been sick after eating here. We LOVE IT, Love the fact that they have a separate cooking area for people with food allergies. I have never had a problem earring here. Menu even has a list of the GF sauces!, There were no problems with gluten being in the food we had a quick great meal. They cooked the gluten free meal in the back., The staff is very accommodating of any allergies or sensitivities. Simply tell them that you have an ""allergy bowl"", and they will cook your food on a separate grill so your food doesn't mix with anyone else's or get touched with the same implements. You build your own bowl, so there is risk of cross-contamination, but you can see what items are stored next to what you're serving. And you can always ask for them to bring an ingredient fresh from the back: just let them know you have a dietary restriction., Its a great place if you're out and need to grab a bite to eat, but I'd rather just cook for myself in my gf kitchen if in going to pick out and put together ingredients anyway., One of my favorite places to eat. Lots of options!, Once the management heard of my allergy they notified me of a special grill that they would cook my food on. Great!!, Awesome love their gf options and grill, Food was ok. Most of the ""menu"" is naturally GF, just ask which sauces are. What I did not like was that they had to take your food into the back to cook on separate grill., love eating here! talk to a manager and they will cook your food in the back kitchen. gluten free sauces clearly labeled.","Jennifer,lucy,merriless,Chrisy,Ashtin,Eric,Trevor,gfgal,ChickP,Michael,Rylie Foster,Monica,Kathryn,Kathryn,Oliver Westervelt III,Hannah ,Cathy,Hanabiko,Susannah,Lisa,Jessica,Dark Helmet,Sarah,Brit,Linda,NicolePisapia,Joni,dtflyerfl,Blessed2BType1Celiac,Alison,Tiara J Bishop,mandy-faith,Joseph,Sarah,Emmie Lou,Jeff n,Kayla Henry,Rachel,User,Rose,Karen Pi,Kari Scare,Jodie,D Willis,User,Stephanie Monahan",CO,17,8,26,80202

Bacon flights are a must!!!!... Huge portions and the best quality!, Talked with the chef / manager and he explained that some of the sauces on the bacon are not gf, thus the bacon flights are not listed as gf. He brought out applewood, candied and habanero bacon slices for me - they were delicious. I also had the bacon hash which was pretty good, but a bit too many onions for me. Not too many things on their menu are gf, but they were knowledgeable about what I could have. And, the bacon was very good. :), Menu has no gluten free items listed and the waiter told me I ""just have to know which items to order"". Was told the bacon has gluten, Not celiac friendly! I spoke with the waiter about the items on the menu and their preparation and told him I needed to be strictly gluten free and needed to avoid cross contamination. He advised that most items, including bacon!!!, was cooked on the same surface as pancakes, etc. He went and spoke with the chef who suggested the whole hog omelet as it is prepared in a separate pan. I ordered the omelet without any sides (normally comes with a bread choice and fried or tots). The omlete cam with a slice of ""gluten free"" bread in-spite of ordering with nothing else. I tested a small sample from the bottom of the omelet and a tiny piece of the bread with my Nima. Gluten was found! I don't know if it was the omelet or the bread, however they learned something and will advise future celiac customers that they cannot prepare something completely gluten free. I was not charged for the omelet., Not many gluten free options, however, the menu is specific about what is gluten free and servers are aware of what kind of substitutions can be made to make a dish gluten free. The Shrimp and Grits and Bacon Hash are excellent!","Grace,debt,Brian Brannon ,Kenneth R Betts,Caitlin",CO,0,2,2,80211

They now have a single fryer, so the chips share oil with everything else. They have taken the gluten free dessert options off the menu; they no longer list ice cream or shakes. They have some decent entrees, but there is not a single appetizer or dessert that is gluten free anymore. It is very frustrating when a restaurant that was quite good about gluten free options decides to remove so many choices., Very good, felt good after. Great salmon, bb ribs, & mashed potatoes, When I order the stake I never have a issue. Be extra careful when ordering a salad and ask questions. The tortilla chips are cross contaminated being fried in the same fryer as other gluten items and tortilla chips are a topping on one of the salads. Server was new and wasn’t able to provide much information.... Normal chain food. Good option for when you are traveling and Need a place.... You can order online and have food delivered by cannot mark at this time to make the food gluten-free., I love the staff and food here! The store manager has celiac knowledge. And the staff always makes sure my food is prepared correctly. As long as your server is informed of your celiac they will do their best to ensure your safety. I get the fajitias or the baked potato soup and salad without croutons. I eat here regularly and havent had any issues. :), They have permanently closed... They have permanently closed, I spoke to the manager and they use the same frier for everything .... lots of cross contamination, They now have a gluten free menu on the kiosk. The waitress was very helpful and assured that the cook would prepare my dish separately. However, my food came out on the same tray as everyone else's food. They are not very knowledgeable but safe when not busy. I did not get sick. Watch out for any of their corn chips or corn tortillas. They are not fried in a dedicated fryer., Willing to cook meat over foil, change glove etc... Plenty of options available for adults and few for children, If you tell them what you need they are VERY accommodating and have an entire gluten free menu online, Our service was great, only complaint I have is I had a 9 year old child that has celiac disease and there was absolutely no gluten free desserts. My granddaughter was sad, and watched her my 12 year old granddaughter eat a dessert., I had soup and salad. It was very delicious. They do a good job with cross contamination. Chips aren't gluten free, and neither is the dip. But very yummy, quite a few options., Was reassured multiple times that everything would be prepared gluten free. Still ended up seriously ill afterwards. Was likely cross contamination, The waitress tried really hard to help me find something I could eat. (Celiac) we found a chicken bowl with veggies. I told her I had Celias and couldn’t have any gluten or I would get very sick. Apparently the kitchen staff has no clue what that means as I got super sick the next morning. There must have been a sauce or something added that no one caught!, Gluten friendly menu. Staff is knowledgeable. Had the Mango-Chilli Chicken. Very good. A little spicy., All food prepared in the same area, gluten free menu is few and far between. Came in hungry, left sick., They have an entire gluten free menu online so I could check it all out as we drive there. They have all items that are gluten free listed and then items that are naturally gluten free but may have cross contamination marked with an asterisk. Our waitress was very helpful and made sure to let the cooks know. We had no problems. Great experience for a first time eating out since being diagnosed., I was torn between 3 stars and 4, but decided to be generous! They first brought out my meal with bread on it - actually under the meat. They made it right though and apologized. The food was good and I had no reaction., I am allergic to wheat and I was having lunch with a group of friends. I researched the GF menu online and I found out that only a few Chili’s have a dedicated fryer. I selected a Chipotle Chicken Fresh Mex Bowl which has:
Grilled chicken, pico, field greens, Mexican rice, corn & black bean salsa, avocado, shredded cheese, tortilla strips, cilantro, chipotle pesto, house-made ranch.
It was listed on the GF menu and I clearly defined my allergy. I asked that they change gloves and carefully make my meal so that there’s no cross contamination. Unfortunately, they put the fried tortilla chips on top of my bowl. Everyone in our group of 9 had all received their meals sand were almost done by the time my meal arrived so I ended up having water for lunch., The server was unaware of what gluten was (they thought it was just wheat) but also thought they could guess whether items were safe based on their own knowledge of it. They did look up on their allergy chart on the table tablet and it had conflicting info so they asked the kitchen, but in general I am concerned this chili tweaks their food (like adding flour to things that doesn't normal have flour) so it's not the same with other chains.... I love Chili's, particularly because they are one of the places that do gluten-free soup. I've had their loaded potato soup many times and never got sick before I had it here. It was also not very good at all and my friend did not like their non-gluten free meal either.... Our server was great, very friendly and attentive, but not well informed about gluten. The food was way below average Chili's quality. I still highly recommend Chili's but not this location., Although I ordered from the online Chili’s gluten free menu and notified my waitress that I have celiac disease, the SanteFe Grilled Chicken Salad was brought to me with a non-gf ingredient added to it that was not listed on the menu. The wait staff seemed at least I attentive if not uneducated regarding my specific dietary needs. The salad was not only contaminated but it was terribly wilted (but the flavor of the chicken was great!)... so NOT worth getting sick over! I won’t go back to this Chili’s 🙁, Food was mediocre, brought me flour tortilla with my fajitas, other orders, casidia was dry, steak over done. Waitress was very nice and service was good. Food just sub-par for a chili's., I asked for gluten free, ordered off the gluten free menu and confirmed it was gluten free and was delivered a flour tortilla taco. They seem to cater to the gluten challenged but if they don’t train their staff better to deal with allergies then you cannot challenge it., Order for 3 people was entirely wrong. 1 person got the wrong side, one got paper in her mayo, the appetizer was wrong and had to be remade, then mine. I told them I had celiac and needed corn tortillas. Luckily I asked the waitress to wait until I looked at the wraps. They gave me flour tortillas and had to change them out. Done. Do not come here PLEASE! One thing wrong, okay....4??? Not a chance., Yes, they have gluten free options on their horrible kiosks that you have to correlate to their menu, but their staff is clueless and has literally no clue about celiacs and cross-contamination. Let’s not reward them for simply having a few menu items that happen to not have gluten., I get take out here all the time and never get sick. They have an awesome allergy menu. I always order the ribs and mashed potatoes. All of their barbecue sauces are gluten free and most of their sides, except the fried ones. Their chips and salsa are also amazing and gluten free, same with the guacamole. They also have good steaks that are gluten free. This is probably one of my favorite restaurants to go to that I don’t have to worry that I won’t be able to find something gluten free., We have been very pleased with Chili's! Our celiac daughter has eaten there several times with no issues, and she is super sensitive. I only wish they had a dedicated fryer for the chips!, Celiac!
A lot of options! Great menu! Have only had one incident when they brought the wrong shells, but it was fixed right away. One of the best places to go!, We get sick EVERY time we eat there. Never again., Every staff member is very educated on celiac and never fails to keep my order safe. A few staff members are even celiac themselves and are especially sure to keep everything safe because they can relate., Came here while visiting family in the area. Although they had a gluten free menu which I ate from, I immediately felt sick after. I’m thinking it was due to cross contamination. Staff also didn’t seem knowledgeable, although very nice., No dedicated gluten free menu. I compared the GF menu from the app and ordered from there. I ordered a bunless mushroom swiss burger and steamed broccoli. Will update review after I eat., Asked for Gluten free options, waitress said only salad, couldn’t guarantee anything else, Ordered chicken fajitas off the gluten free menu. They brought out fajitas with a sauce on them. We questioned it and they apologized that the sauce did in fact have gluten in it. Took forever to get new ones. Would NOT recommend!, The staff was really helpful when I went :), They offer more options than most restraunts that I have found for people that have Celiac., Great options. Their GF menu is on their Ziosk at the table. Special tab on the app., Love protein options here!, We ate here tonight. I was assured that they could handle no cross contamination. Needless to say. I got sick before I got home. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I am only giving it one star because I have to., Told the waitress I had celiac and she took great care of me. My dinner was awesome. I ordered off their gluten free menu. Great experience., Staff was not accustomed to celiac clients, but they did discover they had a “gluten friendly” menu. After several conversations, was able to order a GF meal. Just be careful and specific if you eat here., Nutritional info on the 'Ziosk' is helpful showing gluten items and cross contamination problems. I had the steak fajitas. Felt good afterwards., I asked about the gluten free menu. I was showed the Kiosk with the menu. I thought I chose a ""safe"" meal. The way I felt the next day proved that they don't pay attention when preparing food for peopme with Celiac Disease., After informing my server of my gluten allergy, and her ‘checking with the kitchen’ to make sure it would be, and the guy who brought the food saying that yes it was gluten free. . . It was not. They tossed my grilled chicken in the same sauce as the breaded chicken and I didn’t realize until I had eaten almost all of it and found a large piece of breading in my chicken., I had a really good experience here. I was starving, my flight was delayed, so I risked it. Crystal went above and beyond. I am very gluten sensitive as well as allergic to dairy. I sat there for quite a while afterwards waiting for my flight and had no problems with the food or service., Warning for the tortilla chips. they are not in a dedicated fryer. but all steaks and the margarita chicken salad is good., Mostly burgers without buns, but the also have some grilled chicken with options of mango or margarita flavors., Host said they don’t have gluten free options., I didn't go to this chillis but the usher told us there wasn't much FOR SURE gluten free options. So we headed over the califonia pizza kitchen instead where they had gluten free califlour crust instead. So I can't really rate it., Not celiac safe. They have a gluten friendly menu, but there are no precautions, no dedicated fryer or kitchen space. The gluten friendly menu is nothing more than the regular items that have no gluten ingredients. Ex: Hamburger without bun, Cesar salad no croutons, grilled chicken, ect... They readily admit that cross contamination is pretty much all but guaranteed. If you have celiac or are highly sensitive, do not go here., I don’t typically eat at Chili’s because of so much cross contamination, but was traveling and needed something. Decided on baked potato soup and Caesar salad. Both listed gf on menu. Waiter asked if it was an allergy. He made sure to request they mix salad in a clean bowl and said he watched them make it himself to make sure it was right. ... 3 stars because of limited choices but felt the staff understood the need for no cross contamination., 5 stars because our waiter was OUTSTANDING! If you ever go there ask for Rob. Looks like he’s in his 20s, but he was amazing! He also has celiac and will tell you ALLL You need to know. I love their loaded potato soup, ribs, and mashed potatoes. ASK FOR ROB!!! Tell him there is a good review about him!","JJ,User,Kitty,Destiney,Steve,Lacey,Jessie,April,Gracie,Susan,Brianna,Caighlin,Melissa,Melissa,KellyT,Angel,Jennifer,Dewey,Friendly,Amanda,LindaD,John,Trista,Melissa,randallr,Jordan,teme,kaylee,Joyann Bearden,bella,Alice ,Nicole,Thomas,Emily ,Fallen,Nicole,Angela,Dawn,Leslie,kcgf,Paula,chris,Kerry,Sarah,James,bigguy,Joshua,Ashley,Sarah larsen,Laura,Ann,Ariel",CO,9,15,38,80246

They have a gluten free menu and the waiter was so nice but I still got sick., Food was delicious and server was very knowledgeable about celiac., No longer awesome for GF! :( I'm a celiac, with a very severe reaction. Although I had eaten here dozens of times safely before they have gotten me very sick three times in a row over the last 6mo. The last time we even had talked directly to the manager about my needs and still it wasn't taken seriously and gave me a non GF item I didn't order and then after supposedly starting over on my plate made me seriously ill. I couldn't even walk out on my own. It's too bad., I've eaten here dozens of times & have never gotten sick from gluten. I almost always order the same thing though off the GF menu: the shrimp fajitas. Big portions, fun atmosphere, delicious food including their paper-light chips & salsa, & great margaritas. I've also had good experiences at the DTC & Westminster locations., Generally very good with gluten free options and accommodations. I get the mountain mex bowl with a side of corn tortillas., Was glutened. Was told the chips were OK, but I feel like they may have been the culprit., Great service and the waitress was knowledgeable and made sure everything was served separate! I feel just fine. 😃 The food was amazing! I had the chicken enchiladas and my husband had the fish tacos., Gluten friendly is not gluten free. I had to cancel my reservation and find a different place to eat., Got terribly sick from eating here being glutenized., They've always been great at making sure to note my order is for a gluten allergy so the chef takes extra steps to avoid cross contamination. Comes out before the gluten meals ordered by other people at the table., Great atmosphere, great staff. Large portions. We had fajita for 2, steak and chicken combo. So yummy we should’ve gotten fajita for one and shared. They bring out chips and salsa while you wait for food. We wasn’t disappointed, Great food - lots of choices. I've had the cook come out & talk to me before about food prep!, Love Hacienda! Delicious chips and salsa (and skinny margaritas!), and they have a separate GF menu. My meal always comes out separately (usually carried by a manager), and I've never gotten sick after eating here., Taco on lettuce cup, great.also chips great and helpful staff., If you have allergies, ask before you eat anything. I have a serious MSG allergy and almost every dish has it in their ""seasoning packet."" But once they knew, the manager and chef came out to speak to me. They made a meal with no seasoning, gluten or corn for me that was very fresh and tasty. My family is local and it is one of their favorite local restaurants with 4 children under 5. They are gluten, egg and peanut free., Vegetarian options, awesome margaritas & I have never been sick from eating here. Highly recommend!, They have a very extensive GF (friendly) menu. I’m INCREDIBLY sensitive and they did an amazing job! My waitress was great about communicating with the kitchen.
I had enchiladas and they were SOOO good! Thank You Hacienda for giving my Mexican food options!
They aLSO have a GLUTEN sensitive aka free fryer so the chips and salsa were a go and DELISH!, There is a menu on-line for every possible allergy with lists of what you can order. Bartender made the BEST gluten free margarita. I’m also allergic to oranges and have had such a hard time finding a margarita that I like. Will go back again and again!!!!!, GF menu is slightly limited, but their food is good, servers are knowledgeable, and I can have the chips!! Their chips are not in a shared fryer, so enjoy some guac and chips!!, I have eaten at Hacienda Colorado at this location three times and have never gotten sick. The staff is knowledgeable and happy to help. They have a separate prep area and the dishes are a different color. I was told the dishes are wrapped in saran wrap when removed from the dishwasher to avoid any airborne gluten. The manager brings gf meals to the table and has monitored the preparation of the meal. This review is for this location only., Very celiac friendly. Gluten-free orders are delivered to your table by management., My daughter, who is celiac, was sick all night after going for her birthday dinner. I'm not sure if they changed as we never had a problem before, but will never return after the horrible reaction she had the last time we went., I know on the menu it says that they are not celiac safe- but this specific location is! First time I came in they told me all about their kitchen set up, where they even go so far as to plastic wrap their specifically gluten free green plates. Don't trust that both of them are though, because I got really sick at the one on Colorado blvd. Staff is really great and they even bring out the gluten free meals separately (but of course within a minute of each other!)., I have celiac and never had a problem here. Good selection of GF options and all delicious!, Over priced small Portioned fajitas with lettuce wraps- not impressed., I really like the chips and salsa. I also like their poblano pepper gluten free meal. I have eaten there many times and not gotten sick. I manager usually brings the gluten free meal out and I think the plates are a special shape which is likely helpful behind the scenes., If you are celiac ask for a gf menu and inform your server of a gluten ""allergy"". They then inform the manager who observes food preparation and service to be sure it is gf and not cross contaminated. The fajitas and tacos are delicious. The gf enchiladas aren't worth trying., Great food and gf menu. Our waitress has celiac so she was really helpful and so sweet!, They do a fantastic job, ask to speak to a manager and they will come out and talk about allergies and make sure the food is prepared safely. We eat here often and have wheat and dairy allergies among others., Delicious portobello fajitas. And a dedicated fryer for the tortilla chips! Hurray! I have eaten here many times with no reaction., Good stuff. Full GF menu. Lots of great options so I don't get tired of the same few!, One of our go to places when we visit the Springs. They do specify they are gluten sensitive but, despite having celiac I am able to eat there., I want to like Hacienda a lot! Great atmosphere, fun outdoor dining, etc. however, I find it really spicy and the GF menu pretty limiting. Probably just personal preference!, its a really good place that has a gluten free menu that happens to be a good amount of gf menu options. another cool thing is the fact that their chips are all fried in completely different fryer . I talk to the manager about the chips so you can feel 💯safe. I promise
I haven't had a reaction from this place either so its pretty safe, I really like this place. Has lots of options and servers are very helpful. But I had a Shirley Temple and it kinda ruined my visit because after I drank it my stomach hurt. Don't order Shirley Temples!, Good selection. I had gf carnitas enchiladas, son had gf chicken enchiladas and daughter had gf chicken tacos. They came on different colored plates which always makes me feel better. I didn't order it, but they had tortilla soup too, which is hard to find.

Delicious Mediterranean food! (Would definitely recommend the falafel!) I am a very sensitive celiac & did not feel sick after eating here., food is great!...they are creating more options. love the staff here., Selections are clearly marked. Staff are very careful., Love this location! Staff is trained and prepared to handle GF., I told them I have Celiac and without any other info the server changed her gloves, kept my food wrapped away from any cross contamination risk, and even pulled my pita toppings from the top of a new pan of EVERY TOPING and used a new spoon to avoid any chance of cross contamination. I literally teared up a bit., Watched how they prepared the food and didn’t feel comfortable eating here due to high potential for cross contamination. Left and ate somewhere else., Ordered to go to be delivered to work for lunch. Stated needed GF and asked to change gloves. Everything tasted great!! Apparently too good. Had to leave work and vomited all over inside of car on way home. Will not try again!, Not safe for celiac. They use the serving spoons to spread hummus and such on the gluten pitas, so no possible way to avoid cross contamination. Wish I could just but the gf pitas which are really good!, They got food out of separate containers. Several GF meat and topping options . Very good and reasonable prices, Got very sick from cross contamination, Service wasn’t great and the food was mediocre. Probably won’t go back. But according to their website most of the menu is gluten free., Always have a good experience, staff is quick to change gloves and pull ingredients from bins below to minimize cross contamination. Gf pita is a nice bonus and feels like eating a normal meal., We really enjoyed our lunch at Garbanzos. The service was quick and friendly. The staff was patient and well-informed. I had the gluten free pita with falafel and I loved it. Next time will get the protein, salads and sauces on the plate with the pita on the side. The restaurant is clean and inviting. Well worth it!, I've been here twice. The first time, the server changed gloves and even washed his hands! Everything I ordered was served from underneath the line with fresh utensils. The second time was terrible. I had to insist on everything and it was very frustrating because the server kept insisting that the foods in the line were safe. When you order the gf pita, they wrap it in foil and steam it in the same appliance as the regular pita. One area of my pita was not wrapped properly, so it was likely exposed. Cross-contamination is always a possibility., I was more or less refused service. The guy had a fit when I asked him to change his gloves and if he could reach under the counter. I was absolutely embarrassed. I can’t help having this disease and the restaurant is advertising that they are capable of gluten free., Huge cross contamination risks right in front of me..., Manager said “what’s gluten?” When asked to weigh in on menu items. Avoid!!!, So amazing. Highly recommend. The staff know what they are talking about, and everything was delicious., Not gluten free at all. Gluten free pitas but use some spoons and food so everything is cross contaminated. Bad bad bad, Most everything there is gluten free. The food was really good, Majority of items on menu are GF and are clearly marked as such. Wonderful, flavorful, and fresh meal. Happy to have found it while traveling!, I was highly suspicious when I saw the line everything goes through (starting with a gluten pita mostly). The guy behind the counter did not understand my question about what ingredients were safe (nothing appeared marked). I left- too dangerous for me., Everything is marked on the glass if it’s GF or DF or veg or what not. Have GF pita! Will change gloves, have separate fryer. Can eat falafel! Have lots of sauces to enjoy! And the employees know as well what’s going on., This place has a fryer that just makes fries and chips. The steak is really good and the rice. I definitely recommend this place., I apologize this review is so late. I ate here over the summer and have not had a chance to leave a review. Although the staff was not very knowledgeable about gluten-free the manager was. If I remember right his name was David and he cleaned The entire work area, used plates from a brand new box, and dished my food from the containers underneath that had not been cross contaminated yet. He also made me some gluten-free Pita wrapped in foil to prevent cross-contamination. I felt very cared for at this location during the lunch rush. If only all garbanzos locations took the same care it would be great., Walked in... and the FIRST thing I noticed is that place is CC central.... utensils in contact with the pita, then dunked back into the sauces/ fillings.... and contaminated gloves dunked into the other fix-uns.... walked out.....steer clear of this place....., I was very happy with the options for celiacs. The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable., Very knowledgeable. Lots of options. Workers were great. Gf pita was very good. They toasted it wrapped in foil. Tasty food., Great real food fast. Lots of GF DF options and if you tell them you are Celiac they will serve you from fresh, uncontaminated containers (under the line) with fresh utensils . Very accommodating & a safe place to eat. I also love to get the chips instead of pita and dip them in Baba Ghanouj., I work nearby and I eat here all the time and have never gotten sick (Celiac). The staff is very courteous and knowledgeable and there are tons of options., Second time we've come by to try this place and they have been closed both times (on a Saturday)! So frustrating!, On each of the items labels it states of the item is gluten free, and all but a few are safe. The staff was kind enough to sanitize the environment before beginning to make my meal. My boyfriend got the gf pita bread and he said it was good, it has a hint of sourdough flavor and isn't dry. The falafel here is amazing!, Everything is clearly labeled and the food is delicious and the staff is pretty knowledgeable!, One reason I enjoy visiting the Denver area so much (besides seeing family) is eating at Garbanzo's. I have celiac disease and *have* to eat gluten free. The staff here is a dream to work with. They take care to make sure there is no cross-contamination in anything I order and the food is AMAZING. So good. The falafel is the bomb and their GF pitas are tender and chewy. So so so so yummy.... And for the record - I state I'm celiac and they use clean gloves, get out new containers of sauces and more, and wrap the pita in foil. I ordered a chicken kabob tonight and they made it fresh. I've eaten here a dozen times and have yet to be glutened. I am celiac AND have a severe wheat allergy. It takes a microscopic amount of either to set me off. :), A must to those with Celiac Sprue. There menu is easy to order from on what is gluten free & Lactose free. Thanks to the Server knowledge & labels identifying food allergy info is fantastic. Offer Gluten free & Lactose free pita bread., love that they had everything marked if it was gluten free or vegan., Great gf pitas! Lots of options for gluten free and vegan. Everything is labelled if it is gluten free or vegan. Very knowledgeable and friendly staff!, Even has a Paleo plate now!, Watched them spread ingredients directly onto wheat pitas and place the spatula right back into the ingredients. Hello cross-contamination. Didn't tempt fate here., Love love love. Falafel is GF and so is rice. Everything labeled. Easy, nice staff. Cross contamination ...?? But I didn't have an issue. It was delicious and I will be back. They have GF pita that is delicious, The gluten free pita bread here is AWESOME! It tastes like real gluten. The server knew to change gloves and told everyone else to do the same. I'm so happy there's a Mediterranean food place in town with gluten free pita bread now!, The food is fantastic and they make an effort to offer good GF alternatives. The cross-contamination risk, however, is pretty big as I have personally witnessed them use a scoop to stuff toppings in a pita bread, touching the pita with the scoop and then putting it back into the GF topping container, contaminating the entire container. It's disappointing that they get this aspect of GF prep wrong, yet offer individually-wrapped GF pitas that are protected from cross-contamination. ... The food is delicious and at a great price, their people are very polite, but they are not trained in cross-contamination protocols and I have been glutened here and left the last time without ordering due to the scoop issue. ... Not celiac safe, but probably fine for the mildly intolerant., Staff was trained. The server switched her gloves the moment I said I needed a gluten free meal. All spoons remained in their own container.
The meats that were gluten-free were labeled. I didn't realize that the gyro meat was not gluten-free so I was able to change it before it reached my plate. The server switched her gloves again! So I was incredibly thankful!! Meat is measured in a small container, so I see the potential for cross contamination there. Again, server did not use that container and just placed the meat on my plate.
The gluten-free pita bread was pre wrapped in foil and heated that way to prevent cross contamination. Kudos to the server that I had!!! I was very pleased and she was patient and helpful.
I will say just communicate your needs, stay vigilant and request for things to be done separate, etc...., Cross-contamination central. Delicious food, and most items are GF, but unless you're the first one served that day, your food is likely contaminated by food that's touched wheat pitas, via spoons or bits of rice that were stuffed into a wheat pita then fell out back into the serving bin. A pity, because their falafel (GF) are very tasty. Not a celiac-friendly restaurant., So many delicious options!! My only concern would be the proximity of ingredients to others that aren't GF. I had no reaction to anything and tried just about everything GF they offer. They changed their gloves when I informed them I'm GF, and the entire menu is very clearly marked. Amazing falafel and GF pita!! I will be back many times :), They do a great job of working with food allergy requests, Really good fast Mediterranean food. Will come back again! Everything is clearly marked and they know what they're talking about it., Love this place. Food is great. Good prices. The servers are knowledgeable about what entrees have gluten., Their gluten free pitas are pretty okay while they're hot, but once they cool, not so much. Still, you get plenty of food with a plate or kabob, and its all deliciously seasoned., If you are sensitive to gluten, please don't visit this place. When me and my family came here, we told the server that we were gluten free and she rolled her eyes at us and made our food. The people were judgemental and rude. They made me and my brother share a half serving of meat. The food was okay but too simplistic. There is no gluten free bread or anything so they only advertise gluten free to get more customers. If this simplistic style is just Mediterranean style than I apoligize., We told the girl we needed our order to be gluten free and she acted like she knew what we were asking. I watched her touch the pita from the order in front of us and proceed to grab my bowl with the same glove. I reminded her that she needed to change gloves, and she just said, ""yea, I know,"" and kept the same bowl! Smh!, I love this place. Good food and staff., this place is great they are all so nice and are clearly trained about gluten. all there food is clearly marked. the gluten free pita is sooo good, they wrap them in foil so the can heat the up and not have cross contamination. almost everything on the menu is safe. and when you order the gluten free pita the first question they ask is if it is because of an allergy, say yes and they will guide you through ordering to make sure you are safe. this is a great place to get a good safe meal., There stuff is clearly marked as to what is gluten free. the gluten free pita is wrapped in foil so no cross contamination when it is heated. most of there stuff is gluten free there are only a few things that are not. most of the staff really understands what is safe and what is not. only reason for not giving 5 stars is for the first time I went they said I could have something that I found out this time I could not because it has gluten, no wonder I got sick. also some of there staff is not as well informed as others, but there stuff is clearly marked.","David,Rachel R.,jess,maddy,Susannah,Shannon,Karen,JulesEatsGF,KRobertson12,Casi,travis paul,Kaylee,Claire,Helen,gfvme,Melly,Tommy,Ashley Ewing Parrott,Cassidy,Deanna,Barbara Bonner,Elle,GB,Amanda,Nicole,Susan Barr,kCeliac,Grace,Cindy,Gracefully gluten-free,Hilary,gfAmes,Caitlyn,Julie ,Cherie,GF&LF Kent,Daniella,Krista,maddy,James,Jamie,Delisi Friday,Cat,Gabriela,Dianna,Jeanne,pandora75,Luna,SoCalMimi,Tristan,Ivypool_The_Gluten-Free_Cat,Sam ,Terri,Erin,Erin",CO,18,16,43,80246

They label food items GF, however all items are cross contaminated. Same fryer and same wok used., I ate their twice and got sick twice. I had the GF pad thai on a Wednesday and was sick for almost a week. I thought it might have been another restaurant. So I went back again 9 days later on a Friday. Had the peanut curry with chicken. Sick again. This time much worse. Both times I went was around 7 at night. They clearly mark things gluten free and on both occasions the server said the items are prepared gluten free, not substitutions. So...there must be cross contamination. There's a bit of a language barrier there so not sure how much they know about preparing things in separate pans, avoiding cross contaminant free cooking. There's a ton of soy sauce being used for sure. If you order the side item of steamed vegetables, they are literally drowning in soy sauce, which I didn't touch of course. It may be a safe place for less strict GFers but if you're a Celiac or have a gluten zero diet, I would swing on down the road to somewhere else. Danger danger., Awesome pad thai!!!!, Amazing gluten free Pad Thai ever !!!! Great customer service make sure you try it, This place is delicious. This is my go to place when I go out with friends who are not gluten free. Tom Ka Gai is my favorite soup and both the pad thai and the curries are great. Definitely recommend., Not sure what happened - had a takeout order clearly marked gluten free (with gluten allergy), but had a classic reaction to the food. We ordered Pad Thai Woon Sen (bean thread noodle) and Massaman Curry., I ordered delivery here last night with clear notes about celiac and cross-contamination. When the food arrived nothing was marked for allergens or anything but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. As I ate my beef pad thai I found shrimp (I specifically requested no shrimp), so that’s when I really started to worry. Now today I am super sick and definitely glutened. Beware of delivery I guess., Delicious! Lots of GF options on the menu. I ordered GF Pad Thai and explained that I have celiac. Also ordered some veggie spring rolls that were GF but I used my own GF peanut sauce just to play it safe (we got the order to go)., Delicious! Many gluten free dishes, cooked separately., Food was great! The wine wasn’t good so I will order tea next time. Items are marked GF and GF vegan., We just ate there last night and I was in pain all night. The staff did not take it seriously when I told them, it felt like they didn’t understand., GF satay chicken is delicious. Haven't gotten sick and we eat there all the time. Just make sure to get their items that are GF., Absolutely amazing gluten free pad thai. Menu is clearly marked, and staff understand celiac. This is my go-to!, Great flavor and good selection of Gluten Free items. the best Tom Gah in Denver., I've eaten here probably about 20 times since moving to Denver and have never had an issue. The pad thai and tom yum soup are particularly flavorful here., amazing food! menu is clearly labeled. I had a soup and a curry, with no complaints about either. would absolutely eat here again!, I ways have a good GF experience here! Can't go wrong with SwingThai., Stopped at their Tennyson location, very tasty and quick. Even better, no gluten reaction., I am in Denver for work, and this was my first stop after settling in. They have a clearly labeled menu, great service, and an excellent Pad Thai! Will definitely be back again., A few good dinner selections. But some of the curries have sauce that is so heavy and one can only eat so much Pad Thai. They need to find a way to do a gluten free stir fry or something., Never had a problem here. Been coming here for years. Always enjoy their pad Thai and never had any pain. Their portions seem smaller at this one but might be me, This one is very good too. Clear marked gf menu. Had no problems. Some times their hot tea tastes weird compared to other times, Clear gf menu good amount. Pad Thai is the best on Denver very flavorful alway good service and price. Tom yum is good too. I hear its vegan without fish sauce. I hope so. I drive 35 miles one way to eat here, Love love love this place!

It is very very good! I would definitely recommend!!, I also ate here because they offer a gluten free pizza. The waiter told me that it was a special crust made for them and that it was really good. He said that they can't guarantee it wouldn't be contaminated because of flour in the air, but that they are used to being very careful while preparing it as safe as possible. I also watched it made without hands being washed or gloves being changed. I unfortunately ate it anyway. It tasted good but I got very, very sick from it. I won't return even though this was one of my family's favorite restaurants before I was diagnosed with celiac disease., This place is probably fine for mildly gluten intolerant folks, but definitely not for Celiacs like me or those that are at all sensitive. The pizzaiolo was not wearing gloves, and did not wash his hands between handling the regular dough and the GF dough. Also the oven is shared and all the pies are cooked directly on the same surface. Furthermore, the staff could not tell us if the sauces and toppings were contaminated or not, kind of a moot point after watching the preparation. Shocker, a pizza place that doesn't cater to Celiacs, right? (Sarcasm). I was just hopeful because it's owned by Chipotle and I've had great experiences with their staff and haven't been glutened there. Locale has a GF pizza on the menu, so I thought maybe give it a try. Not so much! I chose not to eat after watching them contaminate the ""GF"" pie several times. My wife is not GF and she tried the GF pie and said it was undercooked and gross anyway. Maybe just trying to make me feel better, but it did look soggy in the middle, and she made a very convincing grossed-out face as she chewed. I actually hated the ambiance anyway, it was loud and the place felt overcrowded even though it was half empty. I feel like we got ripped off because they tried to convince me the pie would be GF but their process makes it impossible to eat it if you really can't have gluten. I paid for it anyway despite not being able to eat it, didn't want the server to have to cover the bill just because I have a disease. The staff was friendly enough but clueless about Celiac disease, and I feel like they could have acknowledged the GF pie that went mostly uneaten except for a single bite that my wife took. Again, expected for a pizza place, but I had higher expectations with it being in Boulder, owned by Chipotle, and associated with Frasca. Won't be back.","Maggie,Angela,RHJ,Steve",CO,0,3,3,80302

I spoke with the general manager and he got defensive and said that's why it's gluten friendly and not gluten free. If you have celiac or gluten sensitivity, do not go there.","Brenna,lisa berkow",CO,1,1,2,80206

The head chef did not care to help out with GF and half of the GF menu is NOT GF. Shared fryers celiacs stay away, Gf is not gf. Three appetizers are soaked in regular soy sauce. All the corn tortillas are fried in the same oil. We got salads and now are unfortunately both very very sick., Excellent gluten free menu. Appetizers, Salads & Entrees. Creme brûlée only dessert option. Good wine list and on e gf beer option. I had the southwest smoked chicken salad, my husband & son both had the filet mignon. We all loved our meals. Very friendly and attentive staff. Fun atmosphere. Indoor & outdoor seating., Their GF menu was heavy on salad, but there were different options than the typical romaine lettuce with chicken or shrimp.... Wonderful food. They had some great seasonal, farm to table options, No dedicated fryer, lots of gf salad options and cool place but not very celiac friendly for kids. They said the mac and cheese is gluten free witxh is hard to believe., I got the sautéed Brussels and they were watery - not sautéed. Nothing was crisp in them at all. My husband got the Chicken Kung Pao and he loved it. It’s a very noisy atmosphere, but a cool interior. Our server was very attentive., Amazing! Have a GF menu and while it’s not huge, it’s got enough variety!, Food was delicious and the environment was a lot of fun. Had a spicy tuna roll, but they didn't have GF Soy Sauce.

I'd go back again and again., Had some great cider and a bunless burger.the waitress was attentive to the Celiacs and made sure everything was good, Told the waitress about being gluten free and she got me the gluten free menu!

I had the sprouts and fish tacos, they were delicious., Gf menu and was very careful in the kitchen for cross contamination . but no gluten free beer, Limited gf menu, but my meal was excellent.

Bad news: told us bacon and fruit cup were all a celiac could eat., visit two: February 2017: I will not be returning. I waited 15 minutes TO ORDER A COFFEE, and was then yelled at by an employee when I complained. I cannot believe how rudely I was treated. ... visit one - April 2015:the food was delicious - lots of options, and the donut holes were scrumptious! the service was very poor, especially on a Sunday morning: 45 minutes for a table, 20 minutes to get plain coffee, and another 30 before the food arrived, with no refills or check-ins between., Neat that they have gf options but this place is not for celiacs. We came here and sat down after a 30min wait only to be told they don't separate gf and regular whatsoever. We left and went somewhere else., The food was fantastic and the service was timely. The staff was very attentive to my gf needs, but the menu does say that cross contamination is possible, which always worries me., Jelly's food was delicious, but their service was pretty terrible. My wife and I spent about an hour waiting for a table (it happens), so when we were seated we expected to be taken care of by an attentive staff. Instead, we were seated, waited 20 minutes to place our orders, then waited another 45 to actually get our food.....and our waitress didn't get our orders right!... That being said, their food was outstanding but if you're on a timetable, go elsewhere. Patience is needed to dine here., Share the donut bites, dense but delicious! Gf toast can be subbed for 50c, Delicious food, a lot of which is inherently non-gluten. I had one of the hashes with some scrambled eggs and GF toast. Also had options for GF pancakes and even GF donut bites! Next time we go we'll be sure to eat the bites there instead of to-go though. Turned into a jelly/custard mess in the box., The GF donuts are a bit dense, but still delicious. The Benedict's are great, just sub some GF toast. GF pancakes are just OK., Not safe for Celiacs. I have not eaten here. I emailed & the response was that the GF menu was for those ""who want to limit their gluten intake"" and that it was not safe for those on a medically necessary GF diet. They do nothing to prevent cross contamination. Go to Snooze. Tell them you're Celiac & they will be careful., Amazing gluten-free donut bites (I got lemon, jelly, cinnamon, and cream and they were all delicious!) I also had scrambled eggs with gluten-free toast that was wonderful. Great service and cute, laidback atmosphere.

No dedicated fryer., Gluten free bread & even gf chocolate cake for my birthday. Doesn't get better than returning a pre-gluten free favorite to places I can go., While they did have labeled menus, their staff was utterly uneducated and served our “gluten free” meals with bread on top - after explaining that both me and my friend had Celiac disease and could have no gluten. Not impressed! This being said, that was at least a year ago, so I pray they’re better now., They had a good gf menu and good food.

I ordered off the GF menu and told the wait staff that it was an allergy., Mediocre, overpriced food, Large GF menu with the option of GF bread or bun. Did not react and the bun was very good. The fries are not GF despite being on the GF menu because they go into the same fryer. Food good but overall knowledgeable about GF, The food was good. Nothing spectacular. Ordered the Philly French Dip. Good, basic bun. French fries were soggy. ... Dedicated GF menu., Dedicated gluten free menu with tons of breakfast, lunch and dinner options.

They do NOT have a dedicated frier and know to advise you against eating any food that has gone through it. The staff is hit-and-miss, some better than others.

Gluten free pitas but use some spoons and food so everything is cross contaminated. Bad bad bad, Staff was trained. The server switched her gloves the moment I said I needed a gluten free meal. All spoons remained in their own container.
The meats that were gluten-free were labeled. I didn't realize that the gyro meat was not gluten-free so I was able to change it before it reached my plate. The server switched her gloves again! So I was incredibly thankful!! Meat is measured in a small container, so I see the potential for cross contamination there. Again, server did not use that container and just placed the meat on my plate.
The gluten-free pita bread was pre wrapped in foil and heated that way to prevent cross contamination. Kudos to the server that I had!!! I was very pleased and she was patient and helpful.
I will say just communicate your needs, stay vigilant and request for things to be done separate, etc...., Garbanzo Mediterranean Grill here! ... We want to ensure the correct information is out there about our gluten-free options. While we have many gluten-free items on our menu and we strive to serve gluten-free guests to the best of our ability, we do not claim zero cross contamination in our restaurants. We are also not GiG trained, despite the rating Find Me Gluten Free has given us. ... If you are gluten-free, please let our servers know as soon as you enter the line. They should do this when you alert them, but if not please ask them to change their gloves, use fresh serving utensils and use fresh food kept in coolers under our front line. ... Our servers are also happy to answer any questions you may have about ingredients. Our website, www.EatGarbanzo.com, is also a great place to find our ingredients list. ... Thank you,... The Garbanzo team, Food is great but I've felt sick every time Ive eaten here despite asking them to take precautions., I told them I have Celiac and without any other info the server changed her gloves, kept my food wrapped away from any cross contamination risk, and even pulled my pita toppings from the top of a new pan of EVERY TOPING and used a new spoon to avoid any chance of cross contamination. I literally teared up a bit., Watched how they prepared the food and didn’t feel comfortable eating here due to high potential for cross contamination. Left and ate somewhere else., Ordered to go to be delivered to work for lunch. Stated needed GF and asked to change gloves. Everything tasted great!! Apparently too good. Had to leave work and vomited all over inside of car on way home. Will not try again!, Not safe for celiac. They use the serving spoons to spread hummus and such on the gluten pitas, so no possible way to avoid cross contamination. Wish I could just but the gf pitas which are really good!, They got food out of separate containers. Several GF meat and topping options . Very good and reasonable prices, Staff very knowledgable about GF items - she changed her gloves & used separate utensils without me having to ask once I told her I had to eat GF. Delicious Mediterranean food! (Would definitely recommend the falafel!) I am a very sensitive celiac & did not feel sick after eating here., Got very sick from cross contamination, Service wasn’t great and the food was mediocre. Probably won’t go back. But according to their website most of the menu is gluten free., Always have a good experience, staff is quick to change gloves and pull ingredients from bins below to minimize cross contamination. Gf pita is a nice bonus and feels like eating a normal meal., We really enjoyed our lunch at Garbanzos. The service was quick and friendly. The staff was patient and well-informed. I had the gluten free pita with falafel and I loved it. Next time will get the protein, salads and sauces on the plate with the pita on the side. The restaurant is clean and inviting. Well worth it!, I've been here twice. The first time, the server changed gloves and even washed his hands! Everything I ordered was served from underneath the line with fresh utensils. The second time was terrible. I had to insist on everything and it was very frustrating because the server kept insisting that the foods in the line were safe. When you order the gf pita, they wrap it in foil and steam it in the same appliance as the regular pita. One area of my pita was not wrapped properly, so it was likely exposed. Cross-contamination is always a possibility., I was more or less refused service. The guy had a fit when I asked him to change his gloves and if he could reach under the counter. I was absolutely embarrassed. I can’t help having this disease and the restaurant is advertising that they are capable of gluten free., Huge cross contamination risks right in front of me..., Manager said “what’s gluten?” When asked to weigh in on menu items. Avoid!!!, So amazing. Highly recommend. The staff know what they are talking about, and everything was delicious., Most everything there is gluten free. The food was really good, Majority of items on menu are GF and are clearly marked as such. Wonderful, flavorful, and fresh meal. Happy to have found it while traveling!, I was highly suspicious when I saw the line everything goes through (starting with a gluten pita mostly). The guy behind the counter did not understand my question about what ingredients were safe (nothing appeared marked). I left- too dangerous for me., Everything is marked on the glass if it’s GF or DF or veg or what not. Have GF pita! Will change gloves, have separate fryer. Can eat falafel! Have lots of sauces to enjoy! And the employees know as well what’s going on., This place has a fryer that just makes fries and chips. The steak is really good and the rice. I definitely recommend this place., I apologize this review is so late. I ate here over the summer and have not had a chance to leave a review. Although the staff was not very knowledgeable about gluten-free the manager was. If I remember right his name was David and he cleaned The entire work area, used plates from a brand new box, and dished my food from the containers underneath that had not been cross contaminated yet. He also made me some gluten-free Pita wrapped in foil to prevent cross-contamination. I felt very cared for at this location during the lunch rush. If only all garbanzos locations took the same care it would be great., Walked in... and the FIRST thing I noticed is that place is CC central.... utensils in contact with the pita, then dunked back into the sauces/ fillings.... and contaminated gloves dunked into the other fix-uns.... walked out.....steer clear of this place....., I was very happy with the options for celiacs. The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable., Very knowledgeable. Lots of options. Workers were great. Gf pita was very good. They toasted it wrapped in foil. Tasty food., Great real food fast. Lots of GF DF options and if you tell them you are Celiac they will serve you from fresh, uncontaminated containers (under the line) with fresh utensils . Very accommodating & a safe place to eat. I also love to get the chips instead of pita and dip them in Baba Ghanouj., I work nearby and I eat here all the time and have never gotten sick (Celiac). The staff is very courteous and knowledgeable and there are tons of options., Second time we've come by to try this place and they have been closed both times (on a Saturday)! So frustrating!, On each of the items labels it states of the item is gluten free, and all but a few are safe. The staff was kind enough to sanitize the environment before beginning to make my meal. My boyfriend got the gf pita bread and he said it was good, it has a hint of sourdough flavor and isn't dry. The falafel here is amazing!, Everything is clearly labeled and the food is delicious and the staff is pretty knowledgeable!, One reason I enjoy visiting the Denver area so much (besides seeing family) is eating at Garbanzo's. I have celiac disease and *have* to eat gluten free. The staff here is a dream to work with. They take care to make sure there is no cross-contamination in anything I order and the food is AMAZING. So good. The falafel is the bomb and their GF pitas are tender and chewy. So so so so yummy.... And for the record - I state I'm celiac and they use clean gloves, get out new containers of sauces and more, and wrap the pita in foil. I ordered a chicken kabob tonight and they made it fresh. I've eaten here a dozen times and have yet to be glutened. I am celiac AND have a severe wheat allergy. It takes a microscopic amount of either to set me off. :), A must to those with Celiac Sprue. There menu is easy to order from on what is gluten free & Lactose free. Thanks to the Server knowledge & labels identifying food allergy info is fantastic. Offer Gluten free & Lactose free pita bread., love that they had everything marked if it was gluten free or vegan., Great gf pitas! Lots of options for gluten free and vegan. Everything is labelled if it is gluten free or vegan. Very knowledgeable and friendly staff!, Even has a Paleo plate now!, Watched them spread ingredients directly onto wheat pitas and place the spatula right back into the ingredients. Hello cross-contamination. Didn't tempt fate here., Love love love. Falafel is GF and so is rice. Everything labeled. Easy, nice staff. Cross contamination ...?? But I didn't have an issue. It was delicious and I will be back. They have GF pita that is delicious, The gluten free pita bread here is AWESOME! It tastes like real gluten. The server knew to change gloves and told everyone else to do the same. I'm so happy there's a Mediterranean food place in town with gluten free pita bread now!, The food is fantastic and they make an effort to offer good GF alternatives. The cross-contamination risk, however, is pretty big as I have personally witnessed them use a scoop to stuff toppings in a pita bread, touching the pita with the scoop and then putting it back into the GF topping container, contaminating the entire container. It's disappointing that they get this aspect of GF prep wrong, yet offer individually-wrapped GF pitas that are protected from cross-contamination. ... The food is delicious and at a great price, their people are very polite, but they are not trained in cross-contamination protocols and I have been glutened here and left the last time without ordering due to the scoop issue. ... Not celiac safe, but probably fine for the mildly intolerant., Cross-contamination central. Delicious food, and most items are GF, but unless you're the first one served that day, your food is likely contaminated by food that's touched wheat pitas, via spoons or bits of rice that were stuffed into a wheat pita then fell out back into the serving bin. A pity, because their falafel (GF) are very tasty. Not a celiac-friendly restaurant., So many delicious options!! My only concern would be the proximity of ingredients to others that aren't GF. I had no reaction to anything and tried just about everything GF they offer. They changed their gloves when I informed them I'm GF, and the entire menu is very clearly marked. Amazing falafel and GF pita!! I will be back many times :), They do a great job of working with food allergy requests, Really good fast Mediterranean food. Will come back again! Everything is clearly marked and they know what they're talking about it., Love this place. Food is great. Good prices. The servers are knowledgeable about what entrees have gluten., Their gluten free pitas are pretty okay while they're hot, but once they cool, not so much. Still, you get plenty of food with a plate or kabob, and its all deliciously seasoned., If you are sensitive to gluten, please don't visit this place. When me and my family came here, we told the server that we were gluten free and she rolled her eyes at us and made our food. The people were judgemental and rude. They made me and my brother share a half serving of meat. The food was okay but too simplistic. There is no gluten free bread or anything so they only advertise gluten free to get more customers. If this simplistic style is just Mediterranean style than I apoligize., We told the girl we needed our order to be gluten free and she acted like she knew what we were asking. I watched her touch the pita from the order in front of us and proceed to grab my bowl with the same glove. I reminded her that she needed to change gloves, and she just said, ""yea, I know,"" and kept the same bowl! Smh!, I love this place. Good food and staff., this place is great they are all so nice and are clearly trained about gluten. all there food is clearly marked. the gluten free pita is sooo good, they wrap them in foil so the can heat the up and not have cross contamination. almost everything on the menu is safe. and when you order the gluten free pita the first question they ask is if it is because of an allergy, say yes and they will guide you through ordering to make sure you are safe. this is a great place to get a good safe meal., There stuff is clearly marked as to what is gluten free. the gluten free pita is wrapped in foil so no cross contamination when it is heated. most of there stuff is gluten free there are only a few things that are not. most of the staff really understands what is safe and what is not. only reason for not giving 5 stars is for the first time I went they said I could have something that I found out this time I could not because it has gluten, no wonder I got sick. also some of there staff is not as well informed as others, but there stuff is clearly marked.","Deanna,Gabriela,Garbanzo Mediterranean Grill,David,Shannon,Karen,JulesEatsGF,KRobertson12,Casi,Rachel R.,travis paul,Kaylee,Claire,Helen,gfvme,Melly,Tommy,Ashley Ewing Parrott,Cassidy,Barbara Bonner,Elle,GB,Amanda,Nicole,Susan Barr,kCeliac,Grace,Cindy,Gracefully gluten-free,Hilary,gfAmes,Caitlyn,Julie ,Cherie,GF&LF Kent,Daniella,Krista,maddy,James,Jamie,Delisi Friday,Cat,Dianna,Jeanne,pandora75,Luna,SoCalMimi,Tristan,Ivypool_The_Gluten-Free_Cat,Sam ,Terri,Erin,Erin",CO,16,16,41,80211

But what they do have is safe at least. I don't trust the buffet, but the packaged salads are good if you can find a GF one., Good selection of packaged GF mixes, GF bread hard to locate & usually stuffed in between the ""regular"" or sprouted stuff. GF bread next to sprouted wheat?? Seriously?... Only source in Denver I am aware of for GF pie shells, just a shame they taste like cardboard. Deli IS NOT SAFE :(... For as much as food here costs, you would think they could take more care in how GF is handled & TASTE what they sell., I had a gluten free soup and ended up in emergency with asphyxia..... 911 plus transportation and hospital bill was only $ 3000, Hot bar and salad bar for takeout items. There is a small bakery with some GF desserts. Grocery store is average-to-small size, but has the basics.... Average-to-small Whole Foods which has the expected staples. Bulk section and salad bar are nice., I stay away from the open bars for risk of cross contamination but their packaged foods is great and same with the food selection and flours for GF. Their Carmel sauce and pumpkin spice have gluten in it if you’re ordering from the coffee bar, but their soy milk is GF. I would ask for a cold drink over hot as the wand they use for oat milk is a risk for cross contamination as well., There are packaged, gluten-free options that are completely safe, but anything on the salad bar or hot bar is open the cross contamination. I usually do pretty well with the soup and salad but have been glutened on occasion from the hot bar., Buffet has ingredient list on food labels however, there is a lot of cross contamination. Have tried it a few times and always got sick from the buffet., Assortment of options. Personally, I do not trust any of the buffet style items so I got my Amy’s Mac and Cheese! I also got a few packaged desserts which were yummy. They have a microwave upstairs too for my frozen Mac and cheese!, Good for GF groceries. Would be nice if they specified whether their prepared foods are GF. Nice cooked stuff and salad bar but celiacs can’t touch. There are no labels on the salad bar stuff, I go here all the time and would know., A wide variety of GF grocery options!, If you're looking for gluten-free foods to cook with there are plenty of offerings. It's a grocery store after all. As far as prepared foods go though it's disappointing that a national ""health food"" store doesn't offer a small selection of made offsite ""fresh"" gluten-free baked goods. None of their prepared food items are made taking any allergy precautions., Plenty of standard gluten free items typical of Whole Foods. The best, however, is the variety of JPs gluten free baked goods they carry in a dedicated section of the bakery., Most of their hot food gives me a reaction, it is because they don’t use a dedicated gluten free kitchen., So many gluten free options. Service is great., Tons of options especially frozen products., Whole Foods is one of the Grocery stores that has the most gluten free stuff, desserts, crackers and more!🤩, Whole Foods has quality foods that are nearly impossible to find elsewhere., Lots of gf options. In chilled section, they have gf prepared meals., Very good selection of Gluten Free food. Nice fresh fruits and vegetables (many organic). Most outstanding feature is definitely their fish market; always fresh and top quality. Liquor department stocks Gluten Free beer (I highly recommend Lake Front Brewing) and cider. Prices are definitely high, but if you’re an Amazon Prime member they have significant discounts on selected items., I can always count on Whole Foods Market to have on their shelves the best quality gluten-free ingredients. I’ve been shopping at whole foods market since 1990!, Awesome selection of gluten free groceries, including multiple brands!, Huge store offering a variety of different gluten-free cereals and flour. Without oats and with gluten-free oats. I think celiacs find there a lot to have something to choose for breakfast., Soup and salad bar is marked very well for allergens. I have never got sick..., They have a good cracker and frozen foods selection especially for high-quality pasta and breaded items. I’m not impressed with its hot bar items. They have palatable frozen pastries and breads but they are a bit expensive and sometimes lack visual appeal because they are broken or have icicles. Once I bought a box of cookies and went to the car for a carb fest. I opened the box and every cookie was broken. I literally had nothing but crumbs and chocolate chips. I declined repurchase. This wasn’t an isolated incident. Whole Foods should be more careful with the shipping and handling of its gluten-free foods due to their composition and fragility.... Unfortunately, Whole foods could do a little better with eliminating unnecessary wheat/gluten products from some ready-made meals; for example, wheat berries or croutons in salads; use tamari instead of soy sauce in marinades., Grabbed a gluten free prepared meal on the way to a restaurant where I knew I couldn’t eat anything. The Pad Thai-esque dish with zucchini noodles was quite good, but pricey. They also have cake from By the Way Bakery., I shop here frequently. They have a ton of options! They also carry a selection of Cherbourg Cyprus desserts in the cold case., Hot bar has very limited gluten free options, and even fewer gluten free proteins. Salad/cold bar has a bit more but when I’m getting prepared food I prefer hot. I was going to get a questionable sushi roll and a bottle of GF soy sauce (they don’t offer GF) but decided to go a couple minutes down the street to Wegmans instead., I would expect a better selection for a place like Whole Foods. Overall, I don't find it worth my time, except for the ""Mybread"" Pita bread in the GF frozen section. Otherwise, I don't find their options to be all that much better than a regular grocery store. And there definitely isn't any pre-made food that is celiac safe if you're looking for a meal on the go., Kind of surprised that Whole Foods in-store restaurant can’t provide a list of allergen info of their menu items. The guy behind the counter had no clue what gluten free even meant. Wow, very disappointed., They have GF options for their restaurant area, sandwich bar, and sushi. The options are limited though and definitely no Celiac friendly. As a grocery store, they have several items that are GF and Celiac friendly., At most Whole Foods GF baked goods are in the freezer section....yup, bummer there is always very little in way of fresh GF baked stuff at WF’s, they did not have many gluten free options in the first place all i could get from the hot foods was mashed potatoes and then had a reaction directly after. definitely some cross contamination happening, one of the only supermarkets in New York where I could find a decent pack of glutenfree (factory) bread. You can also buy glutenfree muffins (freezer), cookies, flour etc., Some deserts are really good but everything gf there is so overpriced., While I don't typically grocery shop here, the chain as a whole is a go-to and a godsend while traveling if you need gluten free or any other allergy free items. The buffet always has options, even in smaller stores like this one, and allergens are marked., Before it was Amazon-owned, I shopped at this WF weekly for most of my groceries. Since then, they no longer carry many of the GF items I used to purchase, including cereals, crackers, snacks. They have substituted other cereals and snacks that have more sugar and less protein than I used to get. Fortunately there are other stores in the area that now carry more products that are GF, unlike when this store first opened., They used to be great about listing ingredients. It’s kind of hit and miss now. Lately the food seems like it is not very fresh. It seems like the food sits for a long time., Great choices but pretty spendy., Not much choices... store disposition was strange., I talked to a chef making taco items who was very rude and unwilling to discuss options with me. He told me that nothing in the made to order, pre-packaged, salad bar area was considered gluten free and said it as if it was absurd for me to not know that., Ate at the buffet/salad bar with no issues. I steer clear from items that are next to gluten items and therefore avoid CC issues. The store itself has a lot of GF items, especially in the frozen/refrigerated sections. Personal-sized cakes, breads, and cheesecakes!, Hot food bar is all labeled if dishes contain wheat, and they have a decent variety of store brand, cheaper gf options., Good selection of GF food at hot bar, you just have to be vigilant about reading all labels before you get something. And of course there are tons of gluten free options throughout the store., The staff was awesome! Francisca asked about my sensitivity and created a separate work station for me. She’s great! Can’t say enough good things, Good old Whole Foods. They carry plenty of delicious GF brands, even Beyond Bread breads. Great for stocking up your kitchen or for a picnic in the park, Love the salad & hot food bar at whole foods. All the items are marked with allergens & there’s very few items with gluten so comfortable with the cross contamination risk of a salad bar. Just just fill your take out box with roast meats, hot sides & salads, Great selection. They have gluten free ravioli in the fresh section and they are so good!, There are many opción gluten free but NO a lot, They make no effort to keep any prepared foods away from contamination such as placing crusty bread on top of the salad bar with crumbs falling everywhere, etc. Labeling looks promising but if you look closely they are often wrong, not matching up with actual food, many don't have allergens listed and use odd wording like graham instead of wheat. Overall, really frustrating that a supposedly healthy store makes zero effort to try and make their foods safe., Of all grocery stores, I find Whole Foods to be one of the most gluten free friendly. Tons of good options. Just make you read the labels!, Great selection of gluten free items!, No fresh gluten free items in the bakery. Very disappointing that the few gf items are frozen or bulk packaged.","Abbey,thetxlady,LIDA SUSAN,Ria,Breanna,Tammy,Asok,gflindsey,GFREE,ashley,N.,Brian,Asok,Maureen,Vin,Nina W,Abbey,ksm,gf-Frank,Margie,Sophie,Martin,Upright Construction,Renee Matthewa,gfteacher20,Melissa,Kelsey,glutenfreecookie,Amy Marois,Justine,KKJ,hayley ,Renske,Ella,Abby,jill,kia,Krista4208,Matthew,Ashley,Lauren,Angela,Gretchen,AshleyA17,maya,Hayley,Nicole,Regi,sharon309,Julia,Liz,Carol",CO,20,6,38,80246

She knew which noodles were gluten free and which items could be made gluten free. I thought I would be safe because she marked my food “allergy alert” but I ended up with a canker sore which is my number 1 sign I’ve been glutened., I have gone twice the second time I found regular pasta at the bottom of my bowl and got very sick, Unsure of the risk of cross contamination... On their website they have an allergy guide that’s very helpful. They have gluten free shell noodles but some of the sauces still contain gluten., They used to be much more accommodating and careful. My celiac daughter has gotten sick the last two times she tried eating there., The manager Nino was so helpful! He answered my questions, told me what they do to keep celiacs safe, and took extra precautions without even asking.... I got the Mac and cheese with the shell pasta. So good it tasted just like I remember the normal Mac and cheese tasting!, Veggie noodles (spiralized) are probably safer than pasta here., I’ve eaten GF at N&C 100+ times. I’m celiac. I understand the risk. Today I ordered pasta bowl w GF pipette shells and a side mac & cheese w GF pipette shells. Both of them had GF pipette shells but both of them had a different single noodle as well...perhaps an egg noodle?
I discovered this late while eating. I probably won’t get sick but that tells me maybe they used a dirty colander or a dirty spoon that had an old noodle on it., Got really sick immediately after eating the gluten sensitive zoodles. I don't recommend if you have celiac or an allergy, Although they can’t guarantee no cross contact, I have eaten their gluten free pipette pasta with butter probably 100 times. Ive never had an issue with getting sick., A lot of options for restricted diets. Unfortunately, the food lacks flavor and high quality ingredients. Both my kids and I didnt finish our meals....even the salad was lackluster., Don't eat here. I went when they were busy, did the whole I'm celiac gluten free song and dance. I ended up cross contaminated to the point where I was screaming in an ambulance and went to the ER given lots of pain meds to cope. Which takes a LOT of cross contamination. They ended up making my gluten free noodles in the same pot as regular noodles. Never again., This noodles and co is the best!!! I always call in my order and speak to the manager about my gluten allergy. I’ve never gotten sick. Highly recommend! The pipette GF noodles are so great!, 5 stars if you're gluten intolerant. They have a lot of absolutely delicious options. However, it is NOT celiac friendly. Not this location, at least. They put their noodles in the same boiling water. I got sick the last time I ate here amd asked if the noodles were all cooked together with regular ones and they confirmed that they were., Delicious gluten free shells. Lately I’ve been getting it with pesto, chicken or shrimp. Yummy! I have celiac, and have not been sick yet.... My family loves the rest of the menu!, I have celiac and have eaten at this location several times without problems. My favorite is the shrimp pad Thai! The coconut curry soup is also delicious. Lots of gf options., I love you good it’s so good the mc in cheese is the best and the rice crispy treats 😁yumm in my tum, When I ordered, I literally told the person 3 different times that I needed my food gf and that I had celiac’s, so please be extra careful with the order. When our food came out, my order was obviously not gf. When I brought it to their attention, I was asked rudely if I ordered it gf. They grudgingly fixed it, but I didn’t feel safe eating the gf replacement., Not Celiac friendly at all. Despite my clear request for strictly GF order, there were udon noodles mixed in with zucchini noodles. I'm just glad I didn't ingest them., Gluten free menu with available substitute rice noodles. Even with allergy alert I still got sick., Staff was knowledgeable and made food in separate pan., Stopped by for lunch today and my daughter got extremely sick even when they marked it for an allergy., Worst noodles I have ever eaten at., The gluten free options are all very tasty, however I do wish there were more options. If I need a quick bite to eat I know I can stop here., When ordering gluten free pasta, they will ask if it is for preference or an allergy. If you say it is for an allergy a manager has to swipe her card and enter a code so they can treat the order properly. I have never had a reaction when eating here., So I haven't ordered anything with a grilled protein, so I can not speak to the certainty of their protocols, but every time I've ordered from them, I've been satisfied with the food & NEVER gotten sick.... they have updated their gluten-free pasta and it is AMAZING!! I only ate half my mac & cheese, so I reheated it the next day expecting it to be mush..I was thrilled with how good the pasta was.... Offers delivery through doordash., I love eating the new Zoodle dishes. I have done really well at Noodles and Company., The gf mac is amazing they marked me as allergy and i have had no problems so happy!, Noodles and Co has recently updated their gluten free noodles. They now offer two kinds: regular rice noodles and shells. They are SO good! I have had their gluten free mac n cheese, penne rosa, and pad Thai. All three are absolutely delicious! Let them know if you have Celiac so they can take extra precautions. The staff is always friendly and the food is brought out quickly. Very affordable prices. One of my favorite places to stop for lunch., Michel, the cashier who helped me, was very friendly and knowledgeable. I can’t say enough great things about her. She had no issue pulling up the nutritional info and letting me know about the GF and DF options. She even gave me a tiny pamphlet called Gluten Guide. The zoodles and rice noodles were delicious. She said for chicken, they scrape the grill. We’re not celiac, just intolerant, so I wasn’t too concerned but she told me the pork and tofu are safe from cross-contamination. The Japanese Pan and Pad Thai are the DF options and we got rice noodles with both. The spicy Korean we ordered with zoodles, and it was yummy. It was more than decent for food in a mall. That’s the only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because the food is great but not amazing. It’s away from the food court on the upper level, and we’ll remember to stop here and let the kids play at the playground when we’re on our way through Wichita again., Noodles is always a wonderful choice for us: kids and adults with celiac. Very accommodating., I eat here once a week because I know it’s one of the only places I can go out to eat without getting sick. Pad Thai with shrimp, pasta Fresca with gf noodles, Mac and cheese with gf noodles, and steak stroganoff with gf noodles are all celiac safe. Love this place!, They have a really good allergy menu and have quite a few items that are gluten free. I always get the pad Thai and never get sick. This is one of my favorite go-to places for quick, gluten free food., Gluten free noodles are pretty good, I got Mac and cheese with gf noodles and it was good. They say you can put gf noodles in any dish, but I was not sure if the sauces were safe. No reaction afterwards., I’ve eaten here a couple of times and the staff was very friendly and helpful each time., Pretty good with cross-contamination. Overall a good place for gluten-free food., We go there all the time, never any issues!, I’ve eaten here a couple times and never had any issues. My favorite place to grab a quick dinner. I also love how the website will offer order suggestions for you if you’re not sure what pasta and toppings are gluten free., They claim to be “gluten sensitive” but they are not. There is wheat in the pesto sauce, according to the cashier in Cottage Grove, MN., Dedicated GF menu. Staff very knowledgeable about cross contamination. Most of their items can be made GF and it’s good., I enjoy the Gf pipet Mac and the pesto zoodles add chicken. They always ask allergy or preference-I say allergy since I’m celiac. The noodles are probably a bit al dente for some, but the sauce makes up for it to me. Haven’t had any reactions and eat here frequently., Eaten here many times, never been glutened. Highly recommend!, Pad Thai is GF and they will ask if it’s an intolerance and will take precautions., I’ve never had issues after eating their gluten free noodles. It’s one of my favorite safe places to eat!, I have eaten here many times and have had no bad reactions. Great place with lots of options. 2 choices of noodles and you can make it any way you like. Though only the pad Thai noodles are only rice. The other gf noodles have corn in them., Twice they have gotten me sick. They used to be great and super careful with my orders but now I won’t go back. Finding other noodles mixed in and breading the chicken even when it’s run under allergy is just ridiculous., I didn’t realize they have a gf menu. If you go onto their website it will let you create a allergen menu specific to you. The gf pasta tasted so good! I had to add it as a recommendation!, They brought me gluten free Mac with parm crusted chicken and my wife the crispy jalapenos. Both gluten.","Shelly,Gianna,Samantha,Julie,Leanne,Katie,Emily,Vera,Ryan,erin,Kate,Allison,Michelle,Olivia,Taryn,Jenny,Heather,Colton,Cassandra,Sarah,Nicole,Mel,Angie,Catherine,Madison Taylor,Stacy,Rachel,Jeri Lynn,Rebekah,Josie,Jennifer,Elizabeth O,alseekford,Anna,Jordan,User,olivia,elise,zduck33,Heather,elise,Y,Kent,Liz,michelle,MFCeliac,Katie,Suze,Allison,Elizabeth,Graham",CO,15,9,36,80222

Super sick after., I’ve tried eating here a few times, and every time I get sick. I’m Celiac, I order off of the gluten friendly menu, and talk to them about allergies. I suspect they don’t understand how to be safe in their kitchen., Gluten free menu readily available with the nutritional information right with it. Plus the food was awesome!!!, Due to the hand crafted nature of our food, variations in our supplier ingredients, and our use of shared cooking and preparation areas, we cannot ensure that our food is free from any allergens. We prepare our foods following procedures to prevent allergen cross-contact, but products containing wheat are made in our kitchens.... They had a great menu and marked that we were gluten free so it was handled safely. Really enjoyed it., Holy amazing tacos... I'd give more than a 5 star review if I could. Very knowledgeable about gf and cross contamination. We will DEFINITELY be back!, We love torchys, I mean who doesn't. My negative rating is to reflect the lack of care around gluten and allergies in general. In 20+ orders, they have literally never gotten it right. A typical order for us is a fresh avocado on corn (from their gluten free menu) or a Baja shrimp (grilled shrimp) on corn. Never once have I not had to go back inside the store. It's always reflected correctly on the receipt, but the kitchen just seems to see the title and ignore the large red letters on there that day gluten free,.or grilled versus fried.. ... I hate given a negative star rating, but no amount of pleading or explaining seems to avoid the need for us to meticulously go through the order when it's delivered and always, always have to go back inside and have them remake. ... Would be absolutely awesome if they could fix their process and I would immediately fix my review (which I've now moved from 5 stars in the beginning, one star at a time to one star).... But once they get it right, (and I'm pretty hungry by that point!), The tacos are great!, We’ve had several good experiences at this location. Staff have been wonderful and taken our concerns seriously. We’ve never been sick., Tacos are really tasty, but a bit overpriced IMHO. $28.00 for 4 tacos and chips and guacamole., I mean, it’s possible, but they follow the alerts on the ticket really well so as long as the server writes it down... Killer tacos, great guac, although pretty damn spicy, chips are gf, never been sick here. Lots of options, probably 65? Percent of the menu can be gf, definitely try the Democrat taco and the fried avocado (unfried though) (it’s straight up just like huge chunks of avocado and beans but it’s freakin tasty)... Apparently their non-gf tacos are also really good, Takes “gluten allergy” precautions... Most tacos are gluten free as long as you get a corn tortilla. Note that chips are on the “gluten conscious” menu but are NOT celiac safe because they are made in a shared fryer, Best Mexican we have had while in Texas on this trip! Staff was great and this is during the Covid-19 situation. Restaurant is opened, also doing curbside and doordash. AMAZING FOOD!!!, Separate GF menu. Ordered it for pickup and they did mess up our order a little. Breakfast tacos were good. Would recommend., They have a big GF menu and are really helpful. Can’t go wrong with tacos!, It's been almost a year and a half since my last attempt at eating at this location. The ordering process seemed to work better and felt fine afterwards. I'll add a star each visit as long as there are no issues., I've had horrible experiences with the location near me in Houston. So. Very. Bad.... But I just had a great experience here in Waco. Considering the effort they put into the menu and checkout process I was satisfied and look forward to more visits in the 4 years to come if my child ends up attending Baylor., GF menu available. Staff able to mark as gluten allergy — At this location, it includes changing gloves and heating corn tortillas in foil or separate area. The chips are NOT GF as they are in a shared fryer, even though queso is listed in Gf menu. Love the independent taco., I have eaten here several times. They have always been knowledgeable on gf menu. My favorite is the crossroads taco and chips w/ queso., I’ve tried eating here a few times, and every time I get sick. I’m Celiac, I order off of the gluten friendly menu, and talk to them about allergies. I suspect they don’t understand how to be safe in their kitchen., As long as I order off the “gluten conscious menu” (uploaded below) then I have not had any issues so far. Just ask for the menu!, Staff member was really helpful. He warned their chips are made in shared fryer. Tacos with corn tortillas are great. Avoid the chips even though they are listed on the “gluten friendly” menu because of the shared fryer., As the chain does have gluten conscious menu, this location completely ignores it. When I placed my order, the cashier treated me as though I was a complete inconvenience. She then messed up my order on purpose and when I asked for it to be remade, she gave total sass. IF YOU FEEL LIKE TORCHY’S GO TO A DIFFERENT LOCATION., They have a ""gluten conscious"" menu. Be very careful about ordering from it, because some items are grilled on the GF menu are breaded on the regular menu, so if you don't specify, you will get breaded. For example, the shrimp in the Baja Shrimp taco, or the mushrooms in the Independent taco. And always ask for corn tortillas. ... Aside from that, the tacos are great, as are the queso, guacamole, and the street corn., I love their breakfast tacos on corn tortillas.
I normally do the pick 3 breakfast item taco which I do chorizo, potato and beans. I will caution that the chorizo is a little on the spicy side but taste so good. I’ve also had their barbacoa tacos with their roja salsa . Overall, great food and service., Not helpful when I asked about gluten free options. The “gluten friendly” menu was most of the same items on the main menu. I have Celiac, so I can’t just have it be “gluten friendly” and be safe. They didn’t have any details about the marinades or what I should really avoid. So I ended up ordering the salad. For $10 I could’ve bought 3 salad mixes at the grocery store and had 4 meals out of it. I got a few items for my husband and he didn’t find it all that good either. Your food is overpriced for what it is., THE BEST TACOS. They had gluten sensitive menu options (grilled instead of fried) so I was able to try a lot of their tacos. Eaten multiple times and haven’t gotten sick. They do fry their chips in the same fryer FYI!, Didn't feel good after some of the orders, felt fine other times., I have had the chips and queso several times, along with the Democrat taco with zero issues. A couple of years ago, I think I may have been glutened, but not any of the recent 5 times I’ve been there!, Hit or miss. Not knowledgeable staff. Cross contamination happens., They have a GF menu. The green chili taco was awesome!, Overpriced, and sued a much better taco joint in town for their name. Would rather eat at DGT who are Celiac friendly and have awesome large portions for realistic amounts of money! Personally haven’t gotten sick here but they never heat up the corn tortillas properly so....., Delicious and separate GF menu, but I did have a reaction. Not a big one, but there may have been some cross contamination., The gf menu is basically if you’re eating gf as a fad and not for intolerance and certainly not Celiac. For it to be gf, most of the sauces and some elements have to be altered but those changes aren’t visible when you get it, and the staff is so rushed they often make mistakes. You can probably safely eat the chips and quest but nothing else., They do have a gluten free menu, and if you do get what you ordered, the food is delicious. But despite ordering a gluten-free taco, they delivered it in a flour tortilla. Then they didn’t bring my whole meal that I ordered. Frustrating., Delicious tacos and sauces! Double layered the corn tortillas so the tacos don’t fall apart. Very flavorful tacos and beans!, Delicious food and lots of GF options. Staff is well-versed and can help you make safe choices, modifications where needed. ... Note about chips at this location: we were recently told that this Torchy’s does not always use a dedicated fryer for their chips!! Typically only on weekends when they are busy enough to use the extra one. We ask every time we go if the chips are fried separately., Had an entire gluten free menu, HOWEVER it’s not truly all gluten free. They use a shared fryer and don’t clarify that on the menu so be careful, This place is kind of hit or miss with being Celiac friendly. I definitely got a taco on a flour tortilla after talking with the girl who took my order about Celiac and gluten. The food is very good and cheap and filling, but it’s risky., Large gluten free menu. Staff seemed knowledgeable about my requirements. Chips have a dedicated fryer. All sauces are GF. Lots to choose from. Ate there last night. So far no effects., We ate two tacos. One with pork and one with brisket. I tried the tortilla and the meat in Nima. approved! Yummy, fast and cheap., Eat here frequently and have never been sick. Amazing tacos and the best queso I have ever had!, Sick for 2 days - wouldn’t try again., GF queso and chips are the bomb - they have GF tacos too - but I recommend trying to go off hours - I worry about CC when they are super swamped!, Do not go here for gluten free. Chips not guaranteed to be fried separate, tacos served with fried shrimp and fried mushrooms even when ordered carefully. They remade my dinner but I still got sick., Great Gluten free menu. Lots of menu choices, Have a gluten free menu and really good about knowing what ingredients need to be changed for safety. Have an allergy key when ordering to alert the kitchen., Great tacos and queso. Eat here all the time with no issues!, Went because I saw the GF “sensitive” menu and the other reviews but unfortunately my Nima gluten sensor detected gluten in my crossroads taco : ( this was at the one on Penn, The staff was very nice and their gf menu had a lot of options!, Democrat tacos are delicious. I’ve never had an issue here or at any Torchy’s. Chips are safe and addictive., I wanted to give this restaurant 2 ratings. A one for their gf options but a 5 for quality and service. Their gluten conscious menu is NOT safe
They cook chips and tortilla on the same grill as flour. If you ask they will wrap it in foil on the grill with care
Also the chicken and beef have gluten
Good food but not super safe of gf friendly, always tell them severe gluten allergy and haven't had an issue. eaten here many times. celiac safe, The food is great but the I got very very sick the last time I ate here. I would not recommend this place to someone with celiac, Gluten sensitive menu. Delicious creative tacos. No reactions after eating there several times.

When I found out I had Celiac Disease, I was so upset that I could no longer eat donuts. I grew up having donuts during the summer on the weekends and I've always just loved eating them. I was so excited to try this place out -- especially since they have gluten free donut holes!... I ordered four gluten free donut holes and told the server I had Celiac Disease. She told me I'd be fine and that the donuts were really good. A different server delivered my donuts (with a ""Jelly's"" flag sticking out of one of the pastries), as well as my sister's regular donuts (sans flag). He said my donuts were gluten free, though they looked exactly the same. The GF donuts and regular donuts were all the same size and color, but the inside texture appeared to be different (or appeared more gluten free).... I've never been so sick in my entire life.... I had to spend the weekend recovering from getting sick, and I called the restaurant today to figure out why I had been so sick. Sure enough, the manager explained that the restaurant uses the same fryer for their gluten free donuts as the regular donuts. She said they never recommend them to Celiac, or even gluten intolerant folks, but rather, people who eat gluten free by choice.... She offered me a free meal at the restaurant, and ensured me that the cooks took more precaution with Celiac-friendly foods in the restaurant. She also told me she would explain to her staff about the donut holes not being safe for Celiacs. At this time, I don't feel safe eating here, but I do have several friends who are gluten intolerant that have been fine. However, I definitely recommend staying away from the donuts!, Great food but indeed cross contamination can happen here., Would highly recommend to any GF diner! My new favorite spot!! Having gluten free donut bites was literally the most exciting thing that has happened in my diet in YEARS! And beyond that, they have many gf substitutions and options on the menu, ALL of the food is spectacular and he service is wonderful and warm to boot!, I told my waiter that I have a milk allergy and asked for no cheese ... And cheese came on my meal. The wait was horrendous and the staff was unaccommodating to a handicap guest I attended the restaurant with. My friend received attitude from two staff members about her wheelchair being in the way (where they stationed us) and rudely asked her to scoot in further (in a low traffic area in the restaurant) several times and it was impossible for her to do so.

SHE WAS INFORMED OF OUR DISSATISFACTION AND RESPONDED WITH ""I HAVENT HAD ANY OTHER COMPLAINTS "" AFTER DISCUSSING WITH HER THE IN FURTHER DETAIL OUR DISSATISFACTION IN CORRELATION TO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE SPENT SHE AGREED TO "" REFUND THE ORDER OR REPLACE IT"" WE THEN WENT BACK TO THE STOR ON 5/12/14 WHERE WE WERE TOLD THAT WE NEEDED TO FIND OUR RECEIPT IN ORDER TO BE COMPENSATED CORRECTLY. ALTHOUGH I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ISSUE BEING TAKEN CARE OF AT A CHIPOTLE AND OFFERED TO SHOW MY CHARGE FROM MY BANK ACCOUNT TO THE MANGER ON DUTY ( ANGELICA?)SHE TOLD ME VERONICA SAID NO WE NEEDED THE RECEIPT. I OBLIGED WITH OUT ANY COMPLAINT AND CAME BACK THE NEXT DAY 5/13/14. WHEN WE RETURNED THE NEXT DAY I WAS TOLD SHE WAS ONLY GOING TO REPLACE ONE OF THE ORDERS AND THAT WAS WHAT HER MANAGER VERONICA TOLD HER. I PROCEEDED TO PLEAD MY CASE AS TO WHY HER RESPONSE WAS UNACCEPTABLE. WHEN I ASKED TO SPEAK WITH VERONICA MYSELF SHE TOLD ME VERONICA WAS TOO BUSY TO TALK TO ME. WHEN I POINTED OUT HER CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ATTITUDE WE WAY BELOW PAR SHE TOLD ME "" DONT TELL ME HOW TO DO MY JOB"" . WHEN I TOLD HER HER RESPONSE WAS NOT WHAT WE WERE TOLD ORIGINALLY AND SHE HAD NOW MADE ME VISIT THE SAME PLACE 3 TIMES OVER 1 ORDER HER RESPONSE IS I WILL CALL THE POLICE ON YOU TO WHICH I REPLIED FOR WHAT?

I THEN TURNED TO THE EMPLOYEES ON THE LINE ( ONE WHO DEFINITELY DESERVES KUDOS AND I WILL GIVE THAT SORY TO YOU LATER WHEN YOU CONTACT ME) AND ASKED HER NAME? THE ""MANAGER"" THEN SAID ANGELICA MY NAME IS ANGELICA VERY RUDELY. SO I DOUBT SHE GAVE ME A REAL NAME. I THEN ASKED FOR ME REFUND CAUSE AT THAT POINT I DID NOT WANT TO CONSUM ANY PRODUCT MADE BY HER HANDS AS IT WAS FULL OF HATE. SHE THEN CALLED VERONICA- THE ONE WHO WAS TO BUSY TO TALK TO ME - BECAUSE ""SHE WAS NOT GOING TO DO THAT"" AFTER REFUNDING FOR 1 BURRITO ON THE ORDER SHE SLAMMED MY REFUND DOWN ON THE COUNTER AND SAID LEAVE MY STORE.... NOW I KNOW THIS IS NO HOW STEVE ELLS ENVISIONED HIS CUSTOMERS BEING TREATED. HIS VISION IS FOOD WITH INTEGRITY BUT HS EMPLOYEES HAVE NONE? THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE ON HOW I WAS TREATED AND HOW THE ISSUE IS STILL NOT RESOLVED., Great gluten free, vegetarian & humanely raised animal options., Chipotle does not have a gluten free menu but instead has a list of gluten-containing ingredients to avoid. Cross-contamination is a concern, however, so let the person taking your order know that you are gluten free and if you need them to take the proper precautions.
From their website: ""If you avoid gluten, don't eat our flour tortillas. If you are highly sensitive to gluten and would like us to change our gloves, just let us know at the start of your order. You should be aware items containing corn, including corn tortillas (chips, soft corn, and crispy corn tortillas) and corn salsa, may have a small amount of gluten from potentially co-mingling with gluten-containing grains in the field.""... Chipotle is one of my ""go to"" places. I visited this location while in town and it was great., Traveling with celiac can be emotionally draining. I walked in and asked if they were familiar with what gluten is, no hesitation and was answered yes, gloves off, hands washed, new gloves on and started changing utensils. All the employees seemed to know how to handle things to keep me safe. A thank you to the employees there is not really enough as the same restaurant down the road looked at me like I was crazy when I asked about gluten free options. Great lunch with great service, can’t beat that!😊, They’re always willing to Change gloves and I feel safe eating there., I always get sick from this place. I mention my allergy and they change their gloves/ get separate spoons but they put the spoons in the same main containers.... their chips are NOT gluten free. They told me they were and I got very sick not educated at all apparently, Had no clue what gluten free is despite their menu offering a gluten free tortilla or taco shell., Every filling is gf.
The only thing not gf is the tortilla. Which is sad because real tortilla are made from corn not wheat.
Take the bowl then, Will wash hands, change gloves and use disposable scoopers if you inform them of your ""allergy."" Everything is gluten free except for the burrito wraps. The shredded cheese and lettuce is grabbed with their gloves so it would be cross contaminated. They will get fresh from the back if you ask. I just try to avoid going when it's busy as to not hold up the line. 🤷🏼, I asked them to change gloves because of an allergy to the tortilla. He immediately dropped the tortilla he was holding directly over top of the rice containers. Then washed his hands, changed gloves and grabbed the empty tortilla wrapper. He crumpled it up threw it away and then asked if I wanted a fresh tortilla and opened the new tortillas..... Need I say more?, i found a long strand of hair in my burrito and the rice was definitely undercooked, i could taste how hard some rice were. the meat was dry and too bland. everything was too salty and i couldnt even finish my food. TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!, They refused to serve me, citing cross-contamination. I even emailed their headquarters. They said no.... They refused to serve me, citing cross-contamination. I even emailed their headquarters. They said no.... They refused to serve me, citing cross-contamination. I even emailed their headquarters. They said no., Most things here are naturally gf, and staff will change gloves if asked.... Bowls, tacos, and salads can be gf, as are chips and even the queso, Many delicious gluten free options, I have been going to this location for years and have never had an issue with an employee not changing their gloves and wiping down the counter... Just say you have a gluten allergy and they will go change gloves!, We travel alot and give Chipotle for a quick easy meal. I am C but say gluten allergy for ease of explanation. They changed gloves. Were very helpful and kind., I got sick, not celiac friendly, Wipe down the counters/where they make the food, change gloves, utensils, and get fresh toppings specifically for allergies... quality and quantity is about the same as if someone wasn’t ordering gluten free... Manager trained a new worker right in front of me and he was extremely knowledgeable and careful about cross contamination., DO NOT GET CHEESE ! I repeat do not get cheese. Even if employees change gloves the cheese is still extremely contaminated. Watch the employees hands as they make someone's food. The first thing they do is touch a tortilla with their glove. The last thing they do is touch the cheese WITH THEIR GLOVE., Always have been knowledgeable and changed gloves and pulled food from fresh containers to avoid cross contamination when informed., Stopped by on our way to South Dakata. They did a great job with preparing my food safely!, When I was here and mentioned I had celiac, staff wiped everything down, took out old spoons from the containers, washed hands/changed gloves, then put got clean utensils and new lettuce. Didn’t even have to ask them to change gloves or get new utensils! Very well trained!, Chipotle ALWAYS gets it right! They wash hands, change gloves, switch utensils, & inform all of the staff down the line! They’re the best & ROCK SOLID for a celiac, especially during travel!... Corn based & fantastic! The only flour in the kitchen is the large burrito wraps, all else is GF!... Eating here is 100% safe, 100% of the time🔥, The only thing with gluten here is the tortillas. Get a bowl, and you won't have any problems at all. I've gone many times without even mentioning my allergy with no problems at all., Most of the time I don’t even have to explain. I just say that I have celiac and they change their gloves and get clean spoons. And they don’t touch the serving spoon to anyone’s food.... The only thing that has gluten is the tortilla.... It’s my go to place for lunch or dinner, Love this place! It’s my favorite fast food place to go to because the only thing that isn’t gf is their flour tortillas., No precautions taken at all. If you wait in line and watch them, it’s basically gluten city. Asking them to change gloves (or put some on because they often don’t wear any) is irrelevant because they touch the flour tortillas with all utensils and allow everything to contact other items. Frequently they’ll overfill and put an ingredient BACK in the tray. So there’s massive x-contamination. DANGER!, They have gloves on and a plexiglass in front of the food and during this crisis they have masks on at all times... You can have a bowl with the same toppings as a burrito, This is seriously the most conscientious Chipotle I have ever eaten in. I live nearby and eat here about once a month. They change all the spoons, wipe down the counter and get out fresh lettuce for me. I have never gotten sick at this location. They are the best. Just let them know before you order and they will take care of you. I am not celiac but very sensitive., They did not change their gloves. Told me they ran out of separate toppings. Same work space... It May have just been this location because usually all chipotles are a safer option, but they told me they ran out of toppings and just threw what they could in my bowel. The same toppings that were touched by flour tortillas and I’m sure there was cross contamination! Truly disappointing! 1 Star, Staff didn’t know what to do . Needed to be asked to put in clean gloves and reminded to use clean utensils. The last time I went to this location I thought they were knowledgeable and did a nice job. Today’s crew had not been trained properly. Also their COVID-19 precautions were very lax. Masks worn improperly or around their necks. Probably won’t be back.... Their COVID-19 precautions were very lax. Masks worn improperly or around their necks. Probably won’t be back., Honestly, I’ve gotten sick eating here twice mostly because I do not think the staff cared about my allergy. Only at a few bites and got sick quick. I ordered according to their online menu that was GF, They do wipe down the counters and change their gloves after washing their hands. They take out the condiments straight from the bag below the buffet style service., The staff was polite and changed gloves when I ordered my rice bowl. However, I noticed as they made someone else's burrito that the serving spoons touched the flour shell and then they put the spoon back in the container. I got extremely sick and suspect it was from cross contamination on the spoons., I have a very sensitive gluten intolerance and every time I try their food I get my symptoms... Only on their website/ nutrition info you can find gluten free information, They are very nice and will always change gloves when asked. I have never in my life gotten sick, and I have eaten here a lot.... If you eat here you cannot get a burrito or a taco, but you can get a bowl! The bowls have all the same stuff that the burritos and tacos have, except for the shell/wrap/tortilla. Everything they put inside the food is gluten free. The chips are also all gluten-free corn chips., They do use flour wraps. But if you tell the worker you are gluten free they will change their gloves, change the spoons, and should also change the lettuce and cheese containers since they stick their hands in with the gluten gloves... Very yummy of course. Gone here for years., Kudos to the manager who upon learning that one of the meals was for a celiac (gluten free) person stepped in and with GREAT personal and serving care assured that there was no cross contamination. 5 Stars for the extraordinary care that was exercised, Workers will change gloves, wash hands, wipe down counter, and bag meals separately. They are compliant and very kind!... Everything at Chipotle is gluten free except the tortillas., Everything at Chipotle is gluten free except the flour tortillas. I LOVE having so many choices!!!, They’ve definitely gone downhill. Last time I got their food, it wasn’t very good (dry chicken, missing ingredients) and I was sick afterwards for several days. Can no longer recommend, I love chipotle! They never disappoint, they always give you a good amount of food. I usually get a bowl and most items on their menu are gluten free and celiac safe., The folks working here were super conscientious about changing gloves, wiping the counter, and using new tongs when I told them of my gluten allergy. The food was great and I feel great!, Cross contamination is high if they don’t change gloves or use fresh utensils. Not Celiac safe. Informed them of this but my meal had evidence of other salsas and meat, so it appears utensils were not changed even though requested. Stopped eating as soon as saw this but still having gluten reaction, Will change gloves, wash hands, and get separate cheese and lettuce if you ask. It really depends on the person you get when you order though. I’ve had both really good and really bad experiences. Most of the time the workers are very friendly but I’ve had a few of the workers get visibly irritated when I tell them I have celiacs.... The food is always good. I love getting the rice bowls and they’re fantastic.... I would give it 5 starts if some of the employees weren’t so rude. A few get visibly upset when they have to wash their hands and change their gloves. It’s just an unsettling feeling when they’re making your food and it’s honestly just really rude., Delicious clean ingredients and they’ll change their gloves and spoons if you tell them you’re gluten free., I've eaten at other chipotles and been ok, but I'm having a major wheat reaction this morning. It's possible it's one of my other sensitivities, but none of them give me this reaction that I know of. ... When I ordered, I told the server about my restrictions. He didn't change his gloves like I've seen at other franchises, nor replace the serving utensils. Like an idiot, I didn't ask him to because I didn't anticipate it being a big deal. And I didn't want to make his life harder during the pandemic. But... Ow., Will wash hands and change gloves if you ask.","Pablo,Monique,User,Sara,JW,Mic,Keena,merilyn,Lauren,Marcduf,Kassie,Mark,Luna,Marsha,Meghan,Leanne,Caleb ,Monique,Katie,aanya,Wil,Ttomeo,Mike,Elizabeth,Marcie Ellen,Zach,Krista,Amelia,Joey,Lucy,Corbin,KarenW,Breanna,chris,LeeAnna Collier,Madalyn,Michelle,Courtney,Sarah,LaÉabha,Brenna Tkac,Tom,Nora,Jenny,Suzanne,Maia,Celia,Amy,JillianKara,Talia,jennifer,K,sophie herrema",CO,4,4,35,80206

The server said no and walked away before I could ask more questions as the menu said nothing about GF options. The app says kid friendly however, I found nothing special to warrant this label and we had 3 small children. When the server came back I asked if they had GF bread...if not what would she suggest. She mumbled that I should stick with an omelette. Because we selected this place an Italian pasta type place I was in no mood for eggs...I had already had 2. It's so frustrating to expect GF options and then only be able to get eggs, a salad, or a bun less hamburger. I would have chosen another option...but all three kids wanted pasta. Bottom line...service is unimpressive and maybe during dinner you can get some pasta. I won't jump to return., The food was good, but be really really careful.

Highly recommend!, Pad Thai is GF and they will ask if it’s an intolerance and will take precautions., I’ve never had issues after eating their gluten free noodles.

They used to be great and super careful with my orders but now I won’t go back. Finding other noodles mixed in and breading the chicken even when it’s run under allergy is just ridiculous., I didn’t realize they have a gf menu.

That’s the only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because the food is great but not amazing. It’s away from the food court on the upper level, and we’ll remember to stop here and let the kids play at the playground when we’re on our way through Wichita again., Noodles is always a wonderful choice for us: kids and adults with celiac. Very accommodating., I eat here once a week because I know it’s one of the only places I can go out to eat without getting sick. Pad Thai with shrimp, pasta Fresca with gf noodles, Mac and cheese with gf noodles, and steak stroganoff with gf noodles are all celiac safe. Love this place!, They have a really good allergy menu and have quite a few items that are gluten free. I always get the pad Thai and never get sick. This is one of my favorite go-to places for quick, gluten free food., Gluten free noodles are pretty good, I got Mac and cheese with gf noodles and it was good. They say you can put gf noodles in any dish, but I was not sure if the sauces were safe. No reaction afterwards., I’ve eaten here a couple of times and the staff was very friendly and helpful each time., Pretty good with cross-contamination. Overall a good place for gluten-free food., We go there all the time, never any issues!, I’ve eaten here a couple times and never had any issues. My favorite place to grab a quick dinner. I also love how the website will offer order suggestions for you if you’re not sure what pasta and toppings are gluten free., They claim to be “gluten sensitive” but they are not. There is wheat in the pesto sauce, according to the cashier in Cottage Grove, MN., Dedicated GF menu. Staff very knowledgeable about cross contamination. Most of their items can be made GF and it’s good., I enjoy the Gf pipet Mac and the pesto zoodles add chicken. They always ask allergy or preference-I say allergy since I’m celiac. The noodles are probably a bit al dente for some, but the sauce makes up for it to me. Haven’t had any reactions and eat here frequently., Eaten here many times, never been glutened. Highly recommend!, Pad Thai is GF and they will ask if it’s an intolerance and will take precautions., I’ve never had issues after eating their gluten free noodles. It’s one of my favorite safe places to eat!, I have eaten here many times and have had no bad reactions. Great place with lots of options. 2 choices of noodles and you can make it any way you like. Though only the pad Thai noodles are only rice. The other gf noodles have corn in them., Twice they have gotten me sick. They used to be great and super careful with my orders but now I won’t go back. Finding other noodles mixed in and breading the chicken even when it’s run under allergy is just ridiculous., I didn’t realize they have a gf menu. If you go onto their website it will let you create a allergen menu specific to you. The gf pasta tasted so good! I had to add it as a recommendation!, They brought me gluten free Mac with parm crusted chicken and my wife the crispy jalapenos. Both gluten.","JB,Tracy ,Gianna,Samantha,Julie,Leanne,Katie,Emily,Vera,Ryan,erin,Kate,Allison,Michelle,Olivia,Taryn,Jenny,Heather,Colton,Cassandra,Sarah,Nicole,Mel,Angie,Catherine,Madison Taylor,Stacy,Rachel,Jeri Lynn,Rebekah,Josie,Jennifer,Elizabeth O,alseekford,Anna,Jordan,User,olivia,elise,zduck33,Heather,elise,Y,Kent,Liz,michelle,MFCeliac,Katie,Suze,Allison,Elizabeth,Graham",CO,16,8,36,80202

Today was a miss. I told my server right away that we are celiac needed to be gluten free. He didn’t seem to know what that meant. I asked him to change his gloves and then as we were giving our order he touched flour tortillas and then our bowl so I asked him to change his gloves again and get a new bowl. They did not get new ladles or do anything else as a precaution against cross-contamination. I’m hoping we don’t get sick. Typically Chipotle has been my go-to because it’s generally safe and a common restaurant when we’re traveling. It seems like they’ve gotten lax in their training., Chipotle does not have a gluten free menu but instead has a list of gluten-containing ingredients to avoid. Cross-contamination is a concern, however, so let the person taking your order know that you are gluten free and if you need them to take the proper precautions.
From their website: ""If you avoid gluten, don't eat our flour tortillas. If you are highly sensitive to gluten and would like us to change our gloves, just let us know at the start of your order. You should be aware items containing corn, including corn tortillas (chips, soft corn, and crispy corn tortillas) and corn salsa, may have a small amount of gluten from potentially co-mingling with gluten-containing grains in the field.""... Chipotle is one of my ""go to"" places. I visited this location while in town and it was great., Traveling with celiac can be emotionally draining. I walked in and asked if they were familiar with what gluten is, no hesitation and was answered yes, gloves off, hands washed, new gloves on and started changing utensils. All the employees seemed to know how to handle things to keep me safe. A thank you to the employees there is not really enough as the same restaurant down the road looked at me like I was crazy when I asked about gluten free options. Great lunch with great service, can’t beat that!😊, They’re always willing to Change gloves and I feel safe eating there., I always get sick from this place. I mention my allergy and they change their gloves/ get separate spoons but they put the spoons in the same main containers.... their chips are NOT gluten free. They told me they were and I got very sick not educated at all apparently, Had no clue what gluten free is despite their menu offering a gluten free tortilla or taco shell., Every filling is gf.
The only thing not gf is the tortilla. Which is sad because real tortilla are made from corn not wheat.
Take the bowl then, Will wash hands, change gloves and use disposable scoopers if you inform them of your ""allergy."" Everything is gluten free except for the burrito wraps. The shredded cheese and lettuce is grabbed with their gloves so it would be cross contaminated. They will get fresh from the back if you ask. I just try to avoid going when it's busy as to not hold up the line. 🤷🏼, I asked them to change gloves because of an allergy to the tortilla. He immediately dropped the tortilla he was holding directly over top of the rice containers. Then washed his hands, changed gloves and grabbed the empty tortilla wrapper. He crumpled it up threw it away and then asked if I wanted a fresh tortilla and opened the new tortillas..... Need I say more?, i found a long strand of hair in my burrito and the rice was definitely undercooked, i could taste how hard some rice were. the meat was dry and too bland. everything was too salty and i couldnt even finish my food. TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!, They refused to serve me, citing cross-contamination. I even emailed their headquarters. They said no.... They refused to serve me, citing cross-contamination. I even emailed their headquarters. They said no.... They refused to serve me, citing cross-contamination. I even emailed their headquarters. They said no., Most things here are naturally gf, and staff will change gloves if asked.... Bowls, tacos, and salads can be gf, as are chips and even the queso, Many delicious gluten free options, I have been going to this location for years and have never had an issue with an employee not changing their gloves and wiping down the counter... Just say you have a gluten allergy and they will go change gloves!, We travel alot and give Chipotle for a quick easy meal. I am C but say gluten allergy for ease of explanation. They changed gloves. Were very helpful and kind., I got sick, not celiac friendly, Wipe down the counters/where they make the food, change gloves, utensils, and get fresh toppings specifically for allergies... quality and quantity is about the same as if someone wasn’t ordering gluten free... Manager trained a new worker right in front of me and he was extremely knowledgeable and careful about cross contamination., DO NOT GET CHEESE ! I repeat do not get cheese. Even if employees change gloves the cheese is still extremely contaminated. Watch the employees hands as they make someone's food. The first thing they do is touch a tortilla with their glove. The last thing they do is touch the cheese WITH THEIR GLOVE., Always have been knowledgeable and changed gloves and pulled food from fresh containers to avoid cross contamination when informed., Stopped by on our way to South Dakata. They did a great job with preparing my food safely!, When I was here and mentioned I had celiac, staff wiped everything down, took out old spoons from the containers, washed hands/changed gloves, then put got clean utensils and new lettuce. Didn’t even have to ask them to change gloves or get new utensils! Very well trained!, Chipotle ALWAYS gets it right! They wash hands, change gloves, switch utensils, & inform all of the staff down the line! They’re the best & ROCK SOLID for a celiac, especially during travel!... Corn based & fantastic! The only flour in the kitchen is the large burrito wraps, all else is GF!... Eating here is 100% safe, 100% of the time🔥, The only thing with gluten here is the tortillas. Get a bowl, and you won't have any problems at all. I've gone many times without even mentioning my allergy with no problems at all., Most of the time I don’t even have to explain. I just say that I have celiac and they change their gloves and get clean spoons. And they don’t touch the serving spoon to anyone’s food.... The only thing that has gluten is the tortilla.... It’s my go to place for lunch or dinner, Love this place! It’s my favorite fast food place to go to because the only thing that isn’t gf is their flour tortillas., No precautions taken at all. If you wait in line and watch them, it’s basically gluten city. Asking them to change gloves (or put some on because they often don’t wear any) is irrelevant because they touch the flour tortillas with all utensils and allow everything to contact other items. Frequently they’ll overfill and put an ingredient BACK in the tray. So there’s massive x-contamination. DANGER!, They have gloves on and a plexiglass in front of the food and during this crisis they have masks on at all times... You can have a bowl with the same toppings as a burrito, This is seriously the most conscientious Chipotle I have ever eaten in. I live nearby and eat here about once a month. They change all the spoons, wipe down the counter and get out fresh lettuce for me. I have never gotten sick at this location. They are the best. Just let them know before you order and they will take care of you. I am not celiac but very sensitive., They did not change their gloves. Told me they ran out of separate toppings. Same work space... It May have just been this location because usually all chipotles are a safer option, but they told me they ran out of toppings and just threw what they could in my bowel. The same toppings that were touched by flour tortillas and I’m sure there was cross contamination! Truly disappointing! 1 Star, Staff didn’t know what to do . Needed to be asked to put in clean gloves and reminded to use clean utensils. The last time I went to this location I thought they were knowledgeable and did a nice job. Today’s crew had not been trained properly. Also their COVID-19 precautions were very lax. Masks worn improperly or around their necks. Probably won’t be back.... Their COVID-19 precautions were very lax. Masks worn improperly or around their necks. Probably won’t be back., Honestly, I’ve gotten sick eating here twice mostly because I do not think the staff cared about my allergy. Only at a few bites and got sick quick. I ordered according to their online menu that was GF, They do wipe down the counters and change their gloves after washing their hands. They take out the condiments straight from the bag below the buffet style service., The staff was polite and changed gloves when I ordered my rice bowl. However, I noticed as they made someone else's burrito that the serving spoons touched the flour shell and then they put the spoon back in the container. I got extremely sick and suspect it was from cross contamination on the spoons., I have a very sensitive gluten intolerance and every time I try their food I get my symptoms... Only on their website/ nutrition info you can find gluten free information, They are very nice and will always change gloves when asked. I have never in my life gotten sick, and I have eaten here a lot.... If you eat here you cannot get a burrito or a taco, but you can get a bowl! The bowls have all the same stuff that the burritos and tacos have, except for the shell/wrap/tortilla. Everything they put inside the food is gluten free. The chips are also all gluten-free corn chips., They do use flour wraps. But if you tell the worker you are gluten free they will change their gloves, change the spoons, and should also change the lettuce and cheese containers since they stick their hands in with the gluten gloves... Very yummy of course. Gone here for years., Kudos to the manager who upon learning that one of the meals was for a celiac (gluten free) person stepped in and with GREAT personal and serving care assured that there was no cross contamination. 5 Stars for the extraordinary care that was exercised, Workers will change gloves, wash hands, wipe down counter, and bag meals separately. They are compliant and very kind!... Everything at Chipotle is gluten free except the tortillas., Everything at Chipotle is gluten free except the flour tortillas. I LOVE having so many choices!!!, They’ve definitely gone downhill. Last time I got their food, it wasn’t very good (dry chicken, missing ingredients) and I was sick afterwards for several days. Can no longer recommend, I love chipotle! They never disappoint, they always give you a good amount of food. I usually get a bowl and most items on their menu are gluten free and celiac safe., The folks working here were super conscientious about changing gloves, wiping the counter, and using new tongs when I told them of my gluten allergy. The food was great and I feel great!, Cross contamination is high if they don’t change gloves or use fresh utensils. Not Celiac safe. Informed them of this but my meal had evidence of other salsas and meat, so it appears utensils were not changed even though requested. Stopped eating as soon as saw this but still having gluten reaction, Will change gloves, wash hands, and get separate cheese and lettuce if you ask. It really depends on the person you get when you order though. I’ve had both really good and really bad experiences. Most of the time the workers are very friendly but I’ve had a few of the workers get visibly irritated when I tell them I have celiacs.... The food is always good. I love getting the rice bowls and they’re fantastic.... I would give it 5 starts if some of the employees weren’t so rude. A few get visibly upset when they have to wash their hands and change their gloves. It’s just an unsettling feeling when they’re making your food and it’s honestly just really rude., Delicious clean ingredients and they’ll change their gloves and spoons if you tell them you’re gluten free., I've eaten at other chipotles and been ok, but I'm having a major wheat reaction this morning. It's possible it's one of my other sensitivities, but none of them give me this reaction that I know of. ... When I ordered, I told the server about my restrictions. He didn't change his gloves like I've seen at other franchises, nor replace the serving utensils. Like an idiot, I didn't ask him to because I didn't anticipate it being a big deal. And I didn't want to make his life harder during the pandemic. But... Ow., Will wash hands and change gloves if you ask.","Amanda,Sara,JW,Mic,Keena,merilyn,Lauren,Marcduf,Kassie,Mark,Luna,Marsha,Meghan,Leanne,Caleb ,Monique,Katie,aanya,Wil,Ttomeo,Mike,Elizabeth,Marcie Ellen,Zach,Krista,Amelia,Joey,Lucy,Corbin,KarenW,Breanna,chris,LeeAnna Collier,Madalyn,Michelle,Courtney,Sarah,LaÉabha,Brenna Tkac,Tom,Nora,Jenny,Suzanne,Maia,Celia,Amy,JillianKara,Talia,jennifer,K,sophie herrema",CO,4,2,35,80302

Not celiac friendly. They use the same sauce and laddel as the regular pizza and cross contamination is a problem., Staff don’t care about gluten allergy. They have gf crust but they don’t even make an attempt to keep it away from wheat flour., Although they changed their gloves, I think they gave me the wrong pizza. I am very sick now., My first experience was like everyone else's. Except I had them pull new sauce and change their gloves. They use a separate cutter now. I complained to corporate and said if they're going to do gluten free than it should be done right. Now they will change their gloves, get new sauce and cheese. It's still a risk but I think the pizza is delicious. It's softer than typical gluten free pizza. I'm sure if everyone mentioned to corporate they'll put a better process into place., This place is probably fine for mildly gluten intolerant folks, but definitely not for Celiacs like me or those that are at all sensitive. The pizzaiolo was not wearing gloves, and did not wash his hands between handling the regular dough and the GF dough. Also the oven is shared and all the pies are cooked directly on the same surface. Furthermore, the staff could not tell us if the sauces were contaminated or not, kind of a moot point after watching the preparation. Shocker, a pizza place that doesn't cater to Celiacs, right? (Sarcasm) I was just hopeful because it's owned by Chipotle and I've had great experiences with their staff and haven't been glutened there, so I thought maybe their pizza franchise would have real GF options, too. Not so much! I chose not to eat after watching them contaminate the GF pie several times. My wife is not GF and she ate and said it was undercooked and gross anyway. Maybe just trying to make me feel better, but it did look soggy in the middle, and she made a very convincing grossed-out face as she chewed., I went to the Highlands location. I would not recommend this for anyone who is sensitive. They use separate pans for GF crust, but they put it into the same oven (sans pan) as the regular crusts. And the sauce comes from the same bowl/spoon as the regular pizzas. My husband ate them and said they were undercooked. Maybe the other location is better., I went to the highlands location and they were clueless about gluten as an allergy and argued with me when I tried to ask for fresh uncontaminated sauce. I tried to explain and was told flour isn't gluteus until water is added. They were very nice when I said I didn't want the pizza but definitely not a place fire a gluten allergy., My first gluten free pizza across the U.S. that actually tastes like the real thing. They keep the crust stored separately even though the topping containers are shared. You have the option to customize the pizza and salads. This is the ultimate in fast and fresh cuisine. We will definitely be back to visit., It wasn't the best GF crust I've ever eaten, but it sure was better than Udi's crust! I enjoyed this place, and I will go back. It's assembly line style, so even at peak dinner time on a Friday night I was in and out with decent speed. They washed their hands before building my pizza, and my pizza stayed on a piece of parchment paper so they did try to avoid cross contamination. However, I'm not sure about working with flour and then reaching into toppings tubs for celiac customers. I enjoyed my pizza quite a bit, and I will go back. Also, the butterscotch pudding was delicious!, Toppings at this place are amazing! The sauce tastes like it's made from fresh Tomatoes. Great flavor combinations and the freshest of ingredients.

Only 7inch size sandwich available. They forgot the bacon on my sandwich and it wasn’t very flavorful., I’ve eaten here without getting sick based on prior reviews, but they cook all their bread in the same oven, which is not celiac safe. When I asked about precautions, they had no answer, Best GF bread I have ever had a sandwich made on. I ordered through grubhub and did not have an issue., I really loved this place! They have gluten free bread and a gluten free menu that shows all the sandwiches. The staff was really knowledgeable and I did not sick after which is alway a good sign! I would definitely go there again!, Tasted too good to be true. I verified with them that it was in fact gf bread. Hopefully, all will work out well. We shall see. Delicious and big!, Great sandwiches and despite a little note next to the register with a cross-contamination warning, I've never had an issue after several months of getting sandwiches there nearly every week. I haven't watched exactly how they prepare the GF sandwiches but they definitely do a glove change (if they don't ask if it's an allergy or a preference (they nearly always do), definitely ask for the glove change)., Wonderful sandwiches. Their gluten-free bread is noteworthy. Good selection., Decently extensive GF menu. And the GF bread is actually hoagie style. Not totally safe if you have severe allergies. Love this place., Great gf subs, loved the bread, The sandwiches were great. The gluten free bread was very good as well. The chips are GF., Snarf's is one of my go-tos because I love sandwiches, and they have gluten free bread options. The downtown location is my favorite for quality, but they all make sure to put gluten free bread on foil before putting through toaster (I'm not sure about their practices aside from that). I'm intolerant to gluten, so I am ok eating here, but I am not sure about safety for those with Celiac's., They have gluten free bread and a gluten free menu posted on their website. There is a high risk of cross contamination, which they disclose on the menu. They usually run out of gluten free bread around 7-8pm, so call ahead and check. I'm leaving a low review because service is terrible at both University City locations., Great gf sandwiches. Picked up over 20 + Sandwiches for a tailgate. All sandwiches and sides were celiac friendly. Thank you to the owner for what he does as I can still have my snarfs sandwiches!, Best gluten free sandwich I've ever had...anywhere. Staff was knowledgeable (changed gloves, put sandwich on foil to reduce/eliminate cross contamination in the oven, etc) and gluten free bread is amazing. My only complaint is that Snarf's is not in Boston yet (I was only visiting Chicago)., NOT celiac friendly. Staff may be knowledgeable but they pull the meat and toppers from the same spread they use for the gluten sandwiches and I had to ask for them to change their gloves. I did not trust eating the sandwich so gave it to my non-celiac husband to eat., Excellent bread because it didn't crumble!!! Staff was mildly helpful about gluten free options when asked about a gluten free menu, stating "" we only have gluten free bread."" I did not get sick. I also had potato salad., The subs were amazing. The gf bread was very good and light. It didn't crumble when you bite into it. The bread only comes in 7"" but I took my leftovers home for lunch the next day. I was perfectly happy with doing that., Couldn't tell it was gf bread it was delicious. I got the Italian sub. They did not mark which sandwich was gf so it was a bit of a panic when it was delivered. Not sure if it's safe for celiacs cause of cross contamination - I did not ask. We ordered it through Uber eats & some of our food was missing but I dunno if that's the driver or restaurants fault., Gluten free OVEN TOASTED sub sandwiches!!! The bread is amazing and they toast the entire sub after building it to give your bread that extra crunch that we usually miss out on with GF bread. They do ask if you're ordering for dietary reasons or allergy and made sure to change their gloves (thank you for understanding!!). I had the Italian and it came with many toppings that I could add including hot peppers. The price of the sub is a bit daunting at $10 but I can only imagine it's because they get the bread from a speciality bakery since it's in a sub sandwich form and far from a hot dog bun you typically find! I also was only able to eat about half of my sandwich since the portion was huge and the bread was filling so next time I will be splitting it with a friend. While Thundercloud has some decent subs, I would say Snarf's is WAAYY better because the bread is toasted which really holds the sandwich together and gives it an overall delicious taste. Their meats are of higher quality as well and offer more free toppings. There is also a location over by UT but I feel very lucky this location is near by my neighborhood and will be back many times more!, My food was made on the same surface as my friend's sandwhich, and the area wasn't wiped off before making my sandwhich. I wouldn't go back due to this reason, and because the sandwhich was not good, Terrific GF sandwiches!, Fantastic sandwiches and gluten free bun is so good I can't even tell it's gf. sooooo sad there isn't still one in Fort Collins! Definitely a must try., delicious is all I can say .....I walked in and I heard the angels choir ....a dedicated gluten free menu that mirrored the regular menu salads and home made salad dressing......it was delicious....took one for the road...it's a must try...a popular chain in the area...., Make sure to let them know if you have Celiac Disease, and to change their gloves, not to toast the bread, or use the same utensils. I was sick both times I tried to eat here - even though I stressed my sensitivity., Hands down the absolute best gluten free sandwich ever!!, Awesome bread!, Not only the best GF sandwich I've eaten; it's the best overall sandwich I've eaten in a LONG time!, I love this place! Not everything on the menu is gluten free, but the staff are knowledgable.

Started getting brain fog about an hour later. Most likely the onion rings and fries are friend in the same oil., Came in extremely hungry after a long trip.

Did not get sick, but left hungry., If we asked if anything on the menu was gluten free we were told a quick and annoyed no.
I felt like we were burdening them by asking questions and no one at the front knew anything about gluten options or ingredients. The manager was short with us and rude. We left without getting anything because it felt so unsafe for us to eat. Ugh.... We left because if I asked if something was gluten free I was just told no or “I don’t know” for literally anything., Lettuce wrap burgers are fantastic. I have had the fries with no issues as well., The girl in the counter didn’t even know what gluten-free options are., So sad they have a separate fryer but Filter all the oil together???

Great location, price, and service., They have a lettuce bun available as a substitute., The staff was able to quickly get answers to my questions. They do not have a dedicated fryer. The do offer Beyond/Impossible patties and the option for a lettuce wrap instead of a bun. On tap is a hard cider option instead of beer. They also serve wine., I had a bacon burger on a lettuce wrap, ""Green Style"". Great meat, and no adverse reaction, but there wasn't anything else on the menu that could be GF. The fries didn't look breaded, but were fried in a shared fryer., Very knowledgeable about celiac, guaranteed me fresh ingredients. Even though the fries are not in a dedicated fryer, that’s the only thing that would make this place perfect., This place is PHENOMENAL!! I had the beyond burger green style but no onions or tomatoes, and it was delicious and filling! The manager Alexander is absolutely amazing and answered all of questions super honestly. He went above and beyond by even going back and making me my own hand cut fries in an area that has no chance of gluten and in a frier that has no cross-contamination and the farthest away from the gluten containing one. The fries were fantastic, too! I heard that the gluten food was absolutely great too, and the custard looks great too!, There is Nothing Safe to eat here, Even the air was unsafe. Wow, less gluten in a loaf of bread., Just went tonight, the man on the prep line said ONLY the lettuce is gluten free, the menu is wrong., The fries are fried in the same fryer as onion rings... so fries weren’t safe., I read reviews before going to the burger place. Reviews stated they had a gluten free menu and fries. Both are not true. Did not eat here. Will not eat here. Do not feel safe here., Nothing there is gluten free.

The BurgerFi sauce is also gluten-free and very good., Have green option ( lettuce) instead of buns. Both veggie burgers are gluten free. No deficated fryer so can't eat the fries, From their website: “GLUTEN OPTIONSThe potato rolls we use have two of the top 10 food allergens wheat and milk. We also manufacture all our products in the same plant and production lines as products with sesame seeds. Most people wanting to avoid gluten can eat anything weserve except for our burger and hot dog buns. We are proud to offer “green style” which is any menu item wrapped in iceberg lettuce. If you are highly sensitive and would like us to change our gloves, we would be happy to do that at your request. Additionally, because our folks work with hamburger bunsall day long, there may be the possibility of cross-contact in our restaurants. We encourage you to carefully consider your dining choices.”, Great food, great service! I had a double cheese burger with bacon, with a lettuce wrap and fresh onion, & jalapenos. The staff was great. They did not have a dedicated fry fryer her so I hesitated. I asked for a small sample (just wanting 3 or 4) of fries before I ordered because I can tell after a few fries if they are going to bother me or not. The ""sample"" if you will, was as big as some places serving. The food came out quickly and tasted great and the servings were giant! And no issues for me. My wife had onion rings not GF but they were HUGE., Lettuce wrap burger, no dedicated fryer for the fries :(, Delicious bun-free burger.

To clarify, I did not feel safe ordering here so never tried their products., All I could eat here was a patty. No fries or even chips., Burgerfi is a grass-fed burger joint. They do not have a gluten free bun, but they do have a lettuce wrap instead of a bun. They are definitely NOT knowledgeable about what gluten is. I came in hopeful and the workers told me everything has gluten and they just tell all customers that everything has gluten. We asked them if there is anything inside the meat and of course they said no, it's just meat. Then we asked if they know what gluten is and of course they said no. They really should educate themselves instead of turning away customers. I almost left, but luckily I am very knowledgeable and know the right questions to ask. We ended up having to talk to the manager, and he was more educated. They cook the burgers in peanut oil and it is cooked on a separate grill than the buns. The basic burgerfi burger and the veggie burger are gluten free (the veggie burger is made with quinoa). I had a burgerfi burger wrapped in lettuce.

Half way through my salad, I found a crouton in my food! I complained to them and they were very understanding and made me a new one. I watched them very carefully the second time around.

Very very good!, I am Celiac and eat here frequently! Never have had any issues with being glutened.

They make the food in front of you (think Subway or Chipotle style) and you can easily add or subtract items from the dishes, or create your own. They use a clean metal bowl to assemble the salads for each customer and there is an individual scoop in each ingredient. It’s one of those rare places where I feel like I can order like a “normal” person and don’t have to ask them a million questions to avoid being miserable later., Tell them you have a gluten allergy when you start going through the line and a single person will put your salad together and make sure nothing with gluten goes in., Almost everything is gluten free.

Instead of taking ingredients out of the normal containers, the worker went into the back and used entirely new batches of the different ingredients. Most of their dressings are GF!, Got sick two times in a row after having one of the GF bowls., Great--I eat here weekly and the staff is educated about cross contamination., I have celiac disease. They use a clean bowl everytume they make a salad, and the person making my salad washed her hands without me even asking.

I was super impressed and my salad was huge even though I just ordered a regular. she was super sweet and I was happy wasn't treated rude and she got new so no contamination, Staff has always been careful to make sure GF, Meh-it was salad. Nothing great. A bit overpriced for what they are. I wouldn't return., I found the mad greens staff to be extremely friendly and helpful and it is easy to order according to individual dietary needs, Mad Greens is awesome, their food is very delicious and fresh made. They also make it very easy to find what is GF, Very over priced and unfriendly toward questions. Just trying to order is a nightmare, even though the menu is labeled. They look at you like you are crazy for even asking how to order gluten free. Great concept, but too much risk of cross contamination for this Celiac., Great salads and staff understands how to make GF options.","gfEmmy,Becca,Ecstacia,Jazan,Kerry,Kelly,Allison,Kristi,LuAnn ,Mallory ,Christa,Aly,Janet,Sheri,Cassie,Michelle Gorham ,Celeste,Stacey,Erica,Lori,gfj,Denise,Kim,Allison,David,Kathy,Claire,Whitney,Melly,Ashley,GF&LF Kent,Krista Dial,MaryKate,Brenda,Derek,Philly_Jasper,gfEmmy,gfEmmy,gfEmmy,gfEmmy,gfEmmy,gfEmmy,gfEmmy,Jody,Ashton,Shelly,kim,Corrie,Corrie,Kimberly,cpearls",CO,18,12,35,80204

Rice noodles were ok but there was a lack of knowledge among the staff., The lady at the counter seemed very knowledgeable about allergies so i felt confident eating here. She knew which noodles were gluten free and which items could be made gluten free. I thought I would be safe because she marked my food “allergy alert” but I ended up with a canker sore which is my number 1 sign I’ve been glutened., I have gone twice the second time I found regular pasta at the bottom of my bowl and got very sick, Unsure of the risk of cross contamination... On their website they have an allergy guide that’s very helpful. They have gluten free shell noodles but some of the sauces still contain gluten., They used to be much more accommodating and careful. My celiac daughter has gotten sick the last two times she tried eating there., The manager Nino was so helpful! He answered my questions, told me what they do to keep celiacs safe, and took extra precautions without even asking.... I got the Mac and cheese with the shell pasta. So good it tasted just like I remember the normal Mac and cheese tasting!, Veggie noodles (spiralized) are probably safer than pasta here., I’ve eaten GF at N&C 100+ times. I’m celiac. I understand the risk. Today I ordered pasta bowl w GF pipette shells and a side mac & cheese w GF pipette shells. Both of them had GF pipette shells but both of them had a different single noodle as well...perhaps an egg noodle?
I discovered this late while eating. I probably won’t get sick but that tells me maybe they used a dirty colander or a dirty spoon that had an old noodle on it., Got really sick immediately after eating the gluten sensitive zoodles. I don't recommend if you have celiac or an allergy, Although they can’t guarantee no cross contact, I have eaten their gluten free pipette pasta with butter probably 100 times. Ive never had an issue with getting sick., A lot of options for restricted diets. Unfortunately, the food lacks flavor and high quality ingredients. Both my kids and I didnt finish our meals....even the salad was lackluster., Don't eat here. I went when they were busy, did the whole I'm celiac gluten free song and dance. I ended up cross contaminated to the point where I was screaming in an ambulance and went to the ER given lots of pain meds to cope. Which takes a LOT of cross contamination. They ended up making my gluten free noodles in the same pot as regular noodles. Never again., This noodles and co is the best!!! I always call in my order and speak to the manager about my gluten allergy. I’ve never gotten sick. Highly recommend! The pipette GF noodles are so great!, 5 stars if you're gluten intolerant. They have a lot of absolutely delicious options. However, it is NOT celiac friendly. Not this location, at least. They put their noodles in the same boiling water. I got sick the last time I ate here amd asked if the noodles were all cooked together with regular ones and they confirmed that they were., Delicious gluten free shells. Lately I’ve been getting it with pesto, chicken or shrimp. Yummy! I have celiac, and have not been sick yet.... My family loves the rest of the menu!, I have celiac and have eaten at this location several times without problems. My favorite is the shrimp pad Thai! The coconut curry soup is also delicious. Lots of gf options., I love you good it’s so good the mc in cheese is the best and the rice crispy treats 😁yumm in my tum, When I ordered, I literally told the person 3 different times that I needed my food gf and that I had celiac’s, so please be extra careful with the order. When our food came out, my order was obviously not gf. When I brought it to their attention, I was asked rudely if I ordered it gf. They grudgingly fixed it, but I didn’t feel safe eating the gf replacement., Not Celiac friendly at all. Despite my clear request for strictly GF order, there were udon noodles mixed in with zucchini noodles. I'm just glad I didn't ingest them., Gluten free menu with available substitute rice noodles. Even with allergy alert I still got sick., Staff was knowledgeable and made food in separate pan., Stopped by for lunch today and my daughter got extremely sick even when they marked it for an allergy., Worst noodles I have ever eaten at., The gluten free options are all very tasty, however I do wish there were more options. If I need a quick bite to eat I know I can stop here., When ordering gluten free pasta, they will ask if it is for preference or an allergy. If you say it is for an allergy a manager has to swipe her card and enter a code so they can treat the order properly. I have never had a reaction when eating here., So I haven't ordered anything with a grilled protein, so I can not speak to the certainty of their protocols, but every time I've ordered from them, I've been satisfied with the food & NEVER gotten sick.... they have updated their gluten-free pasta and it is AMAZING!! I only ate half my mac & cheese, so I reheated it the next day expecting it to be mush..I was thrilled with how good the pasta was.... Offers delivery through doordash., I love eating the new Zoodle dishes. I have done really well at Noodles and Company., The gf mac is amazing they marked me as allergy and i have had no problems so happy!, Noodles and Co has recently updated their gluten free noodles. They now offer two kinds: regular rice noodles and shells. They are SO good! I have had their gluten free mac n cheese, penne rosa, and pad Thai. All three are absolutely delicious! Let them know if you have Celiac so they can take extra precautions. The staff is always friendly and the food is brought out quickly. Very affordable prices. One of my favorite places to stop for lunch., Michel, the cashier who helped me, was very friendly and knowledgeable. I can’t say enough great things about her. She had no issue pulling up the nutritional info and letting me know about the GF and DF options. She even gave me a tiny pamphlet called Gluten Guide. The zoodles and rice noodles were delicious. She said for chicken, they scrape the grill. We’re not celiac, just intolerant, so I wasn’t too concerned but she told me the pork and tofu are safe from cross-contamination. The Japanese Pan and Pad Thai are the DF options and we got rice noodles with both. The spicy Korean we ordered with zoodles, and it was yummy. It was more than decent for food in a mall. That’s the only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because the food is great but not amazing. It’s away from the food court on the upper level, and we’ll remember to stop here and let the kids play at the playground when we’re on our way through Wichita again., Noodles is always a wonderful choice for us: kids and adults with celiac. Very accommodating., I eat here once a week because I know it’s one of the only places I can go out to eat without getting sick. Pad Thai with shrimp, pasta Fresca with gf noodles, Mac and cheese with gf noodles, and steak stroganoff with gf noodles are all celiac safe. Love this place!, They have a really good allergy menu and have quite a few items that are gluten free. I always get the pad Thai and never get sick. This is one of my favorite go-to places for quick, gluten free food., Gluten free noodles are pretty good, I got Mac and cheese with gf noodles and it was good. They say you can put gf noodles in any dish, but I was not sure if the sauces were safe. No reaction afterwards., I’ve eaten here a couple of times and the staff was very friendly and helpful each time., Pretty good with cross-contamination. Overall a good place for gluten-free food., We go there all the time, never any issues!, I’ve eaten here a couple times and never had any issues. My favorite place to grab a quick dinner. I also love how the website will offer order suggestions for you if you’re not sure what pasta and toppings are gluten free., They claim to be “gluten sensitive” but they are not. There is wheat in the pesto sauce, according to the cashier in Cottage Grove, MN., Dedicated GF menu. Staff very knowledgeable about cross contamination. Most of their items can be made GF and it’s good., I enjoy the Gf pipet Mac and the pesto zoodles add chicken. They always ask allergy or preference-I say allergy since I’m celiac. The noodles are probably a bit al dente for some, but the sauce makes up for it to me. Haven’t had any reactions and eat here frequently., Eaten here many times, never been glutened. Highly recommend!, Pad Thai is GF and they will ask if it’s an intolerance and will take precautions., I’ve never had issues after eating their gluten free noodles. It’s one of my favorite safe places to eat!, I have eaten here many times and have had no bad reactions. Great place with lots of options. 2 choices of noodles and you can make it any way you like. Though only the pad Thai noodles are only rice. The other gf noodles have corn in them., Twice they have gotten me sick. They used to be great and super careful with my orders but now I won’t go back. Finding other noodles mixed in and breading the chicken even when it’s run under allergy is just ridiculous., I didn’t realize they have a gf menu. If you go onto their website it will let you create a allergen menu specific to you. The gf pasta tasted so good! I had to add it as a recommendation!, They brought me gluten free Mac with parm crusted chicken and my wife the crispy jalapenos. Both gluten.","User,Gianna,Samantha,Julie,Leanne,Katie,Emily,Vera,Ryan,erin,Kate,Allison,Michelle,Olivia,Taryn,Jenny,Heather,Colton,Cassandra,Sarah,Nicole,Mel,Angie,Catherine,Madison Taylor,Stacy,Rachel,Jeri Lynn,Rebekah,Josie,Jennifer,Elizabeth O,alseekford,Anna,Jordan,User,olivia,elise,zduck33,Heather,elise,Y,Kent,Liz,michelle,MFCeliac,Katie,Suze,Allison,Elizabeth,Graham",CO,15,8,35,80203

They have a GF bread that tastes really good, but there must be cross contamination in the kitchen. ... Their online menu sometimes lists the GF bread as an option for a pricey $3 upcharge. ... Online menu and store menus do not list ingredients or GF options. Save yourself a lot of pain and eat somewhere else!, The staff was a bit short and messed up the toppings on every order but the sandwiches were amazing. Neither of us had any reaction and can’t wait to go back., Staff not familiar with celiac, I had the Greek salad and the Enchilada soup, both GF and delicious and I didn’t get sick., Would not recommend this place if you have celiac. Order a salad and talked to them about the cross contamination. When the gal was making my Salad she was also doing others at the same time which had wheat. So ask to remake mi e which they did but again with cross contamination. So ask for money back. Manager was very rude argue with us
Finally give money back and total us to leave. This was my first time in the one in Lakewood and last!!!!, Did not get sick. The staff was knowledgeable with options and cross contamination. Food was served quick and was delicious. I would definitely go there again., I explained to them that I had Celiac Disease and they assured me it would be done separately. I opened my bag and realized oyster crackers were added into my bag (clearly not gluten free) and Nima tested the sandwich and soup. Both came back positive for gluten. So disappointed., Nima tested and came back positive for containing gluten., Had no idea about gluten free., Tremendous find; great flavors. Will definitely be back next time we're in San Angelo. Gluten free bread somewhat dry., Everything was very good but on the expensive side. However the bread didn’t taste like I was missing out on anything like most gf bread. It was just a good meal. I’ll be back., The bread alone is worth the trip (and is made locally in Longmont), but the entire sandwich was really delicious., Gluten-free baguette was great consistency and taste! We'll be back!, Really good GF Baguette! Never gotten sick here, Terrible service. The manager or owner sat on her phone and watched me wait for service for 5 minutes and as I was leaving without being helped she than yelled for her workers. It was too late, Food was relatively quick. Pretty good. They had a gluten free bun option, though I didn't get one. I would go back again. 3 Celiac individuals in our group, 3 different items ordered, no one got sick. And like I said, was pretty good, too., I eat here every time I am in town. Their gluten free bread is great and worth the up charge. They can make almost anything gf. They even have 5 breakfast options. They do not have chips though which is weird considering all the sand which options., Very good! I love having a yummy gf sandwich option., Best gluten free bread I've had!!, Had the delicious Chicken Enchilada soup and sandwich! Worth the $3 up charge for the gluten free baguette!! Would definitely eat here again., I asked for a gluten-free menu and placed my order off the gluten-free menu. when the ordered came it w as on regular bread. When I asked of it wa s gluten-free the server said you didn't say to make it gluten-free and proceeded to argue with me. Finally remade sandwich on a stale gf baguette and the filing was not adjusted for size and density of bread., Gf menu and tasty bread. I would go back, Baguette was just ok. The bread was quite dry and fell apart. But one good thing was they were very accommodating for gluten free customers and prepared it separately and changed gloves etc, Great GF baguettes
Weak coffee - needs work, A GF menu with lots of choices. Ive ate here twice and both sandwiches were good. There GF hoagie is excellent but a bit pricey., Very good gluten free buns! We've never gotten sick and eat here frequently!, I have celiac disease and have eaten here on multiple occasions without a problem. The have a separate GF menu. Their GF buns are delicious!, Plenty of GF options for both soups and sandwiches. Always careful to protect the work space when you mention celiacs or an allergy., Great service and great gluten free buns! They even brought mine out separate to avoid contamination. I've ate there a few times with no issues., Enjoyed breakfast here 2 days in a row. The skillet was great. The GF baguette was awesome despite a $3 up charge. I felt safe eating here., About $13 for a large drink and sandwich. Sand which was really good and almost a foot long. No chips available. Cashier wasn't friendly. Did not get sick!, Smiling Moose is our go-to in Fargo because it's fresh, reasonably priced, and reliably gluten-free., They have delicious GF sub sandwich style breads and can make just about any of their sandwiches list on the menu into GF., My daughter has celiac with severe reactions and has eaten here at least a dozen times with no problems. She absolutely loves the bread rolls and is so happy to be able to eat a real sub sandwich! Great staff!, First time trying gluten free bun - highly recommend., very friendly, but the gluten free bread was awful., great GF bread and sandwiches. the best place for everybody with celiac people that like bread! very friendly staff, make to order, very accommodating always., because there a so much better bread options out there now for sandwiches I have to rate low. The bread is dry and they never put enough cheese or sauce to chew it down., Great GF sub bread option & rice Krispy treat., Very good GF breakfast sandwich. Always brings my food out with foil to keep separate from others, OUT OF GLUTEN FREE ROLLS., This is not a restaurant for people with Celiac disease. They were nowhere near careful enough with our gluten free order, and we did get very sick. Don't even risk it here, no matter how bad you want a sandwich., we go there all the time and have only had one time where they didn't have gluten free bread. my kids even love their Gluten free sandwiches., They do offer gf options. While waiting for our food I had the opportunity to view the kitchen staff. One of the cooks hugged another worker, his gloves touched the back of the other and didn't change gloves. (Not just a Celiac issue.)One worker on the final prep side had NO gloves and handled our gf bread and also other orders. Even though I specified one of our sandwiches had to be gf, I don't believe they really understood what to do. I asked the gloveless worker, ""Shouldn't you be wearing gloves?"" He said sorry and put them on after I told him my husband couldn't eat the food he had just prepared due to cross-contamination. He replied that he didn't realize it was for a Celiac order. (Even though I shared this info when I ordered. Maybe they don't have a way of sharing this with all the workers?) The worker then changed gloves and the cook prepared another sandwich. A third worker picked up my husband's (2nd) sandwich and I couldn't say for sure that he had new gloves, but I seriously doubt it. Perhaps if you can go at a slow time between meals you would have better luck. They did place the sandwich on gf bread and on foil before going through the toaster oven. This was at the Edwards, CO location. No complaints about the quality or taste, just about their understanding of cross-contamination., They are either closed or have moved. There is a Freebird Burrito or something like that at the address listed for this location., They have GF BREAD!!! They can make just about any of their sandwiches from the menu into GF. I have seriously not had a sandwich this good in years since having to be GF! Their GF bread was a full size sub bun style and very soft & delicious! Definitely my new favorite!, A tad expensive, but delicious and safe., Yummy hoagies, The gluten free bread is some of the best I've had. They only have one size so If you order a foot long you will get two sandwiches. I was stuffed after one.... I can't comment on how celiac friendly this place is, as I didn't ask about their specific protocol for gf orders. I think there's always an inherent risk dealing with sandwich shops since there is so much bread floating around., Special separate gluten free menu.... Breakfast items, salads, hoagies. ... Pleasant customer service too.... Hours posted below are incorrect., Yes, they have gluten-free bread for sandwiches, but they charge $2 extra for it and it tastes terrible.","annie,Brenda,Kelly,Robin,donna,Lynn,Jennifer,Jennifer,Amanda,Leslie,S.Milone,Alissa,Gregory,Josh,Bryce,Brian,Frank,Kjmenz,Sarah,Silke,Kat,Tracy,Nicole ,Daveybob ,Casey,GF traveler,ni,Chris,Becky,Tiffany,Frank,Taylor,User,Amie,Heather,cynthia,Joanna Clark,Deanne,gfyummy,Madison,Laura,Matt Nordberg,Sarah,jbro,Tammy,User,Elizabeth,GF since 1998,Tom,GF since 1998,Ashley",CO,19,4,29,80203

Gluten free options include pasta, burgers (with buns), and cheesecake for dessert.... The options are great, but it’s simply not a safe place for celiacs. If you’re just avoiding gluten and don’t have to be strict, then go for it, but our waitress assured us that it was not safe for celiacs., They have fryers that are supposed to be dedicated gluten free, but they’ll put gluten-containing foods in them when they get busy.... I had the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake which is gluten free and amazing. We decided not to order dinner because the kitchen is not careful., Cheesecake factory marks GF food on the menu and offer gluten free pasta substitution for their dishes. The sever was very helpful with suggesting a GF dish. I went with the chicken garlic pasta dish with the gluten free pasta. However I was sick for days after. The pasta was for sure gluten free and the chicken was unbreaded. I suspect the garlic sauce possibly contained gluten or maybe there was cross contamination when the dish was being prepared., They have a separate fryer for gluten-free French fries! I checked and both the location on Topanga Blvd in the valley and the location in Thousand Oaks have dedicated fryers for French fries only. When I asked they did warn me that they can’t guarantee nothing else could ever accidentally get in the fryer because other stuff is nearby in the kitchen, but they said nothing breaded ever goes in that fryer. So I ate the fries and they were good and I didn’t get sick. ... Also, if you order through doordash then some items (like the fries) have a button you can check that says “make it gluten-free”!, They have a separate fryer for gluten-free French fries! I checked and both the location on Topanga Blvd in the valley and the location in Thousand Oaks have dedicated fryers for French fries only. When I asked they did warn me that they can’t guarantee nothing else could ever accidentally get in the fryer because other stuff is nearby in the kitchen, but they said nothing breaded ever goes in that fryer. So I ate the fries and they were good and I didn’t get sick. ... Also, if you order through doordash then some items (like the fries) have a button you can check that says “make it gluten-free”!, Mush have no safety protocols because my wife had a non-gluten free noodle in a gluten free pasta.... The quality and quantity is ok but doesn’t make a difference when there are non gluten free noodle in gluten free dish., Multiple staff lied to me multiple times about the fries being gluten free. They have a shared fryer and it’s highly cross contaminated. I asked so many times if they were gluten free!... Staff not educated on cross contamination or just liars, Never gotten sick eating here! I had the gf four cheese pasta and gf Godiva chocolate cheesecake. Waiters/staff seem to understand :), Found gluten pasta in my gluten free past and the staff did not care, Last time I was there, the manager told me that they use the same pot of water to cook all pastas including the gluten free pasta. I wouldn’t recommend eating here., They have a good amount of items that are gluten free. Their Turkey burger is honestly my favorite and now they have 2 different gf cheesecakes. We unfortunately usually have something wrong with our order EVERY time (for take out). So even though I haven't gotten sick here yet, I feel like I'm rolling the dice every time we order., Called ahead and the staff understood and would accommodate by prepping gf pasta separately (normally all pasta boiled together). Ordered with a seemingly knowledgeable server but 10-15 min after our order was in the manager came out and told us they were out of gf pasta?! I have no idea how it took so long for them to bring this to our attention but it was too late to go somewhere else so we ended up getting a gf bun with butter (my 4 year old is incredibly picky and that was the only other thing they had available). Points for trying to make it right and knowing what celiac meant and not just subbing reg pasta, but the whole experience was incredibly annoying as they didn’t have the gf food they had listed on the menu and the server didn’t know they didn’t have it either., My girlfriend has celiacs and ordered the gluten free pasta and got horrendously sick about an hour later. No indication that anything was wrong. If it was pure gluten it would have hit her in 20 min so it had to be cross contamination. Do not put yourself at risk!!!, There are gluten free options, brick chicken is delicious they also have gluten free buns if you would like a burger...Godiva gluten free cheese cake...Pasta dishes they list as gluten free are not truly.. was told same water as regular pasta, no dedicated fryer for fries...., The staff was very knowledgeable about cross contamination and walked me through the different gluten free menu items., I have celiac disease for the last three years I’ve been going to the cheesecake factory in Peabody in the last two weeks I’ve been going there for breakfast three times at the last two weeks they screwed up my order the management has to teach the kitchen staff about celiac disease they don’t seem to understand about celiac poor management training, Eles possuem GF Menu !!! Todos bem especificados no cardápio ! Solicitei o Bacon Bacon Cheese Burger 🍔 e estava divino ! O pão é maravilhoso e macio ! Uns dos melhores que já comi !!! Super valeu a pena !, Waiter was knowledgeable about gluten free dishes and aware of cross contamination concerns. Dedicated fryer for French fries. I got a burger and it was great!, Great selection on the menu! Not a specific gluten free menu, so you have to look carefully on the regular menu. Lots of choices & even two gluten free cheesecakes!, I asked for something gluten free and explained the severity. The server said he understood and when he brought my food he even made a point to say they left off the breadcrumbs. I thought I was ok until I took a few bites and found the breadcrumbs were just stirred in to cover the mistake., I have silent celiac but have always trusted Cheesecake Factory to prepare my food carefully (despite an incident at another location where they served me a regular hamburger bun). However on my last visit I got a pasta dish and after eating the whole thing I saw a regular noodle at the bottom. I got a very unsatisfactory response from the manager there and made a complaint to corporate with no response yet. Sad to see this has happened to others here and unfortunately I don’t think I would trust eating at this chain again given these 2 incidents which were both handled poorly by the restaurants., I’ll preface my review by saying I have a lot of migraine triggers and that’s also my main symptom to gluten and dairy exposure. There were a good amount of gf options. Only 1 gf cheesecake option and my daughter was able to eat that. Godiva chocolate and she said it’s amazing. I also have a dairy allergy so it’s trickier. I got a turkey burger on a gf bun. I really liked it. They said the fries were safe and they were good too. My daughter got a pasta dish and liked it. I did end up with a migraine and not sure if it was due to this restaurant or some other trigger. I would eat here again., The staff there was really friendly and understood the limited options. They has almost every main food item on the menu with a gluten free option. The cheesecake was delicious!, Nice variation of gluten free options and they give a note to the chefs to be sure there’s no cross contamination. I’ve been there a couple times now and have never gotten sick!, Very limited selection of GF items. I was not impressed with the spicy chicken tacos. I had eaten her before and got glutened by the Shepherd's pie., One of the best places to get gf options. The menu is huge and they have good gluten free pasta. I’ve had items modified too to be made gluten free. Never had any problems. Plus the gf cheesecake is great., Knowledgeable waiter. Asked if I was Celiac or had a gluten allergy. Said he would make sure the cook made my food separately. Some unavoidable cross-contamination., My previous review was really bad on this place. And I don’t mean just this location, I mean everywhere. But I just went again and they had gluten free buns, fries, etc. Best thing, and the cheesecake is amazing like always. Definitely go again!, The food tasted delicious but I felt sick immediately after eating the mushroom burger. Ended up being sick all night., One mention of allergies throws the kitchen in a head spin and they play it safe to the point where it's almost insulting., Ate at this restaurant with specific instructions to the waiter about Celiac food preparation three years ago. They did not follow easy directions. Food was seriously cross contaminated. GF cheesecake was baked and stored next to wheat cheesecake. I was sick for three months. Never again. These chains do not understand what GF really means and how dangerous their cavalier attitude about it can be for Celiac’s. Do not eat here, you will get sick., Had gluten free pasta, but I found a different noodle in my dish. I’m not sure if it’s a different type of gluten free noodle or not but it shows that they aren’t too careful., The waiter knew nothing. I asked about an omelette, thinking it would be a safer choice, and it was marked gluten free. I wanted to make sure all of the ingredients were gluten free and he said “meat doesn’t have gluten ... I don’t think.... so the bacon should be fine” Yeah.... . He later reassured me that what I ordered was all gluten free. Now I am sick. Thanks., Server was helpful to point out gluten free items on the menu and my meal was flagged for celiac/gluten allergy. The Skinnylicious soft chicken tacos were fantastic!, Very few options, and it appeared that many meals were unable to be altered. Super disappointing., They do have several GF items in the menu. I tried their GF old fashioned burger. The meat was pretty good, but, overall, the burger didn’t have much flavor. I’ve had GF burgers in other restaurants that have tasted much better. Additionally, $14 is way too high for a burger from my perspective., The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly! GF choices are marked in the menu. The Bacon-Bacon Cheesburger was very tasty! Fries are separate fried., I have never had a problem with this location. They have lots of yummy options, Ate here tonight. Had a hamburger, and fry’s. They have a separate fryer! Everything was amazing. The waiter was very knowledgeable about celiac., Ate here with a large party, so I know that’s hard on the server. However, they will now direct you to an allergen website and won’t answer questions about the food or prep; our server answered one question about the fries but otherwise said he was required to go get his manager (which ultimately might be great, but was very awkward with a large group of professional colleagues and also wasn’t stated as a solution or being helpful, more as a response to me being a difficult patron). I almost decided not to get food, but ultimately chose something I get might be most safe. I think it was ok, but it’s hard to say because I’m traveling and already sick. Celiacs use caution or avoid., Our waitress was not educated on what was safe. She offered us French fries, which I already knew are not safe. Me celiac daughter got sick after eating a burger on a gf bun., April 2019 - Tried this location for first time last week. Had Cobb salad with ranch (balsamic that normally comes with cob is not gf) and had no crutons. Took a couple slices of my own gf udi multigrain bread and they brought me butter. Waitress was knowledgeable about celiac options. Had no issues. Salad was a little bland but nice to have another family option. May try blue cheese dressing next time which is also gf.... Update: have gone several more times this year with no issues. Also Godiva cheesecake is GF but I advise you only get if buy a whole frozen one to take home and thaw out in fridge before eating (the sliced ones in the restaurant case are next to gluten deserts so I avoid getting slices at the restaurant). These are the best GF deserts I know of., Cheesecake Factory has an extensive gluten free menu with pastas and entrees. I ordered the four cheese pasta with gluten free noodles and chickens. Cheesecake Factory also has a Godiva gluten free cheesecake., I just became gluten-free, and it's been a hard adjustment. So naturally, I was scared eating out, as it's supposed to be a fun celebration, and not something to dread. When I called to see if they had a gf menu, they assured me that they absolutely did. When I went there, while the server didn't 100% know if items that weren't labeled gf were (they seemed to be), she checked with both the manager and the chef. Thank goodness that I don't have to loose one of my favorite restaurants. I had the chicken farfalle gf dish and fries for a snack, and didn't have any pain. While they only have one option for cheesecake, it was still good., Very nice great gluten free options , they only had one gluten free cheese cake desert and it was worth it ,, Dedicated fryer .. was warned that it is next to the regular fryer so they did warn me about the slight risk of cross contamination but that they had never had any complaints from celiacs. I am celiac and took the risk and seemed to be fine from it. The burger was great too. I had tried to eat at this chain in Canada before and didn't have much luck but I was thoroughly impressed with the menu this location had. I would go back for sure!, Needs a zero star option. I explained I’m celiac and how important it was to protect against cross contamination and ordered a gf pasta. When it came out thank goodness I asked if it was Gf. They said “on no that’s the regular past sorry we forgot”. I was so mad I cried., They have gluten free options for pasta, burger and a cake. They clearly mark gluten free in their menu. I think they serve things as gluten free and not as gluten friendly but def something to ask next time, Regular food sucks but the cheesecake is amazing!!","Leandra,ttp,Jen,erooster,Leah,Cynthia,Annmarie,Celly,Celly,Austin Trosclair,Jill ,Melanie Mauldin,Leah ,Kate,Jackie,Defne,j,Darlene,Kristen,Thomas,Simone,Brittany,Jadyn,Andrea Robbins,Debra,Pam,Abigail,Delaney,Donna,EM3,Joseph Keenan,lanar1013,Maxine,Paul,Joanna,Michele,Chad,Heather,Amy Faith,B,Nadia,Emily,Dione Baird,s in FL,Kirsten,AustinDad,Peter Myers,jennifer,Vikki,Caitlan Hunter,Brittney,Charlie,Jo D",CO,18,14,37,80202

I asked if they had gluten-free noodles and separate cooking areas, etc. They assured me that they did. ... After I had eaten 2/3 of my Pad Thai, I noticed a large hollow wheat noodle mixed in with my GF rice noodles. I returned my food and asked them to remake it. One lady there (the cook?) had the worst attitude about it, and was hesitant to do her job. ... Fast-forward 12 hours:... I am celiac, and I've been sick all night., The lady at the counter seemed very knowledgeable about allergies so i felt confident eating here. She knew which noodles were gluten free and which items could be made gluten free. I thought I would be safe because she marked my food “allergy alert” but I ended up with a canker sore which is my number 1 sign I’ve been glutened., I have gone twice the second time I found regular pasta at the bottom of my bowl and got very sick, Unsure of the risk of cross contamination... On their website they have an allergy guide that’s very helpful. They have gluten free shell noodles but some of the sauces still contain gluten., They used to be much more accommodating and careful. My celiac daughter has gotten sick the last two times she tried eating there., The manager Nino was so helpful! He answered my questions, told me what they do to keep celiacs safe, and took extra precautions without even asking.... I got the Mac and cheese with the shell pasta. So good it tasted just like I remember the normal Mac and cheese tasting!, Veggie noodles (spiralized) are probably safer than pasta here., I’ve eaten GF at N&C 100+ times. I’m celiac. I understand the risk. Today I ordered pasta bowl w GF pipette shells and a side mac & cheese w GF pipette shells. Both of them had GF pipette shells but both of them had a different single noodle as well...perhaps an egg noodle?
I discovered this late while eating. I probably won’t get sick but that tells me maybe they used a dirty colander or a dirty spoon that had an old noodle on it., Got really sick immediately after eating the gluten sensitive zoodles. I don't recommend if you have celiac or an allergy, Although they can’t guarantee no cross contact, I have eaten their gluten free pipette pasta with butter probably 100 times. Ive never had an issue with getting sick., A lot of options for restricted diets. Unfortunately, the food lacks flavor and high quality ingredients. Both my kids and I didnt finish our meals....even the salad was lackluster., Don't eat here. I went when they were busy, did the whole I'm celiac gluten free song and dance. I ended up cross contaminated to the point where I was screaming in an ambulance and went to the ER given lots of pain meds to cope. Which takes a LOT of cross contamination. They ended up making my gluten free noodles in the same pot as regular noodles. Never again., This noodles and co is the best!!! I always call in my order and speak to the manager about my gluten allergy. I’ve never gotten sick. Highly recommend! The pipette GF noodles are so great!, 5 stars if you're gluten intolerant. They have a lot of absolutely delicious options. However, it is NOT celiac friendly. Not this location, at least. They put their noodles in the same boiling water. I got sick the last time I ate here amd asked if the noodles were all cooked together with regular ones and they confirmed that they were., Delicious gluten free shells. Lately I’ve been getting it with pesto, chicken or shrimp. Yummy! I have celiac, and have not been sick yet.... My family loves the rest of the menu!, I have celiac and have eaten at this location several times without problems. My favorite is the shrimp pad Thai! The coconut curry soup is also delicious. Lots of gf options., I love you good it’s so good the mc in cheese is the best and the rice crispy treats 😁yumm in my tum, When I ordered, I literally told the person 3 different times that I needed my food gf and that I had celiac’s, so please be extra careful with the order. When our food came out, my order was obviously not gf. When I brought it to their attention, I was asked rudely if I ordered it gf. They grudgingly fixed it, but I didn’t feel safe eating the gf replacement., Not Celiac friendly at all. Despite my clear request for strictly GF order, there were udon noodles mixed in with zucchini noodles. I'm just glad I didn't ingest them., Gluten free menu with available substitute rice noodles. Even with allergy alert I still got sick., Staff was knowledgeable and made food in separate pan., Stopped by for lunch today and my daughter got extremely sick even when they marked it for an allergy., Worst noodles I have ever eaten at., The gluten free options are all very tasty, however I do wish there were more options. If I need a quick bite to eat I know I can stop here., When ordering gluten free pasta, they will ask if it is for preference or an allergy. If you say it is for an allergy a manager has to swipe her card and enter a code so they can treat the order properly. I have never had a reaction when eating here., So I haven't ordered anything with a grilled protein, so I can not speak to the certainty of their protocols, but every time I've ordered from them, I've been satisfied with the food & NEVER gotten sick.... they have updated their gluten-free pasta and it is AMAZING!! I only ate half my mac & cheese, so I reheated it the next day expecting it to be mush..I was thrilled with how good the pasta was.... Offers delivery through doordash., I love eating the new Zoodle dishes. I have done really well at Noodles and Company., The gf mac is amazing they marked me as allergy and i have had no problems so happy!, Noodles and Co has recently updated their gluten free noodles. They now offer two kinds: regular rice noodles and shells. They are SO good! I have had their gluten free mac n cheese, penne rosa, and pad Thai. All three are absolutely delicious! Let them know if you have Celiac so they can take extra precautions. The staff is always friendly and the food is brought out quickly. Very affordable prices. One of my favorite places to stop for lunch., Michel, the cashier who helped me, was very friendly and knowledgeable. I can’t say enough great things about her. She had no issue pulling up the nutritional info and letting me know about the GF and DF options. She even gave me a tiny pamphlet called Gluten Guide. The zoodles and rice noodles were delicious. She said for chicken, they scrape the grill. We’re not celiac, just intolerant, so I wasn’t too concerned but she told me the pork and tofu are safe from cross-contamination. The Japanese Pan and Pad Thai are the DF options and we got rice noodles with both. The spicy Korean we ordered with zoodles, and it was yummy. It was more than decent for food in a mall. That’s the only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because the food is great but not amazing. It’s away from the food court on the upper level, and we’ll remember to stop here and let the kids play at the playground when we’re on our way through Wichita again., Noodles is always a wonderful choice for us: kids and adults with celiac. Very accommodating., I eat here once a week because I know it’s one of the only places I can go out to eat without getting sick. Pad Thai with shrimp, pasta Fresca with gf noodles, Mac and cheese with gf noodles, and steak stroganoff with gf noodles are all celiac safe. Love this place!, They have a really good allergy menu and have quite a few items that are gluten free. I always get the pad Thai and never get sick. This is one of my favorite go-to places for quick, gluten free food., Gluten free noodles are pretty good, I got Mac and cheese with gf noodles and it was good. They say you can put gf noodles in any dish, but I was not sure if the sauces were safe. No reaction afterwards., I’ve eaten here a couple of times and the staff was very friendly and helpful each time., Pretty good with cross-contamination. Overall a good place for gluten-free food., We go there all the time, never any issues!, I’ve eaten here a couple times and never had any issues. My favorite place to grab a quick dinner. I also love how the website will offer order suggestions for you if you’re not sure what pasta and toppings are gluten free., They claim to be “gluten sensitive” but they are not. There is wheat in the pesto sauce, according to the cashier in Cottage Grove, MN., Dedicated GF menu. Staff very knowledgeable about cross contamination. Most of their items can be made GF and it’s good., I enjoy the Gf pipet Mac and the pesto zoodles add chicken. They always ask allergy or preference-I say allergy since I’m celiac. The noodles are probably a bit al dente for some, but the sauce makes up for it to me. Haven’t had any reactions and eat here frequently., Eaten here many times, never been glutened. Highly recommend!, Pad Thai is GF and they will ask if it’s an intolerance and will take precautions., I’ve never had issues after eating their gluten free noodles. It’s one of my favorite safe places to eat!, I have eaten here many times and have had no bad reactions. Great place with lots of options. 2 choices of noodles and you can make it any way you like. Though only the pad Thai noodles are only rice. The other gf noodles have corn in them., Twice they have gotten me sick. They used to be great and super careful with my orders but now I won’t go back. Finding other noodles mixed in and breading the chicken even when it’s run under allergy is just ridiculous., I didn’t realize they have a gf menu. If you go onto their website it will let you create a allergen menu specific to you. The gf pasta tasted so good! I had to add it as a recommendation!, They brought me gluten free Mac with parm crusted chicken and my wife the crispy jalapenos. Both gluten.","Jessica,Gianna,Samantha,Julie,Leanne,Katie,Emily,Vera,Ryan,erin,Kate,Allison,Michelle,Olivia,Taryn,Jenny,Heather,Colton,Cassandra,Sarah,Nicole,Mel,Angie,Catherine,Madison Taylor,Stacy,Rachel,Jeri Lynn,Rebekah,Josie,Jennifer,Elizabeth O,alseekford,Anna,Jordan,User,olivia,elise,zduck33,Heather,elise,Y,Kent,Liz,michelle,MFCeliac,Katie,Suze,Allison,Elizabeth,Graham",CO,15,8,36,80206

I had a gluten free soup and ended up in emergency with asphyxia..... 911 plus transportation and hospital bill was only $ 3000, Hot bar and salad bar for takeout items. There is a small bakery with some GF desserts. Grocery store is average-to-small size, but has the basics.... Average-to-small Whole Foods which has the expected staples. Bulk section and salad bar are nice., I stay away from the open bars for risk of cross contamination but their packaged foods is great and same with the food selection and flours for GF. Their Carmel sauce and pumpkin spice have gluten in it if you’re ordering from the coffee bar, but their soy milk is GF. I would ask for a cold drink over hot as the wand they use for oat milk is a risk for cross contamination as well., There are packaged, gluten-free options that are completely safe, but anything on the salad bar or hot bar is open the cross contamination. I usually do pretty well with the soup and salad but have been glutened on occasion from the hot bar., Buffet has ingredient list on food labels however, there is a lot of cross contamination. Have tried it a few times and always got sick from the buffet., Assortment of options. Personally, I do not trust any of the buffet style items so I got my Amy’s Mac and Cheese! I also got a few packaged desserts which were yummy. They have a microwave upstairs too for my frozen Mac and cheese!, Good for GF groceries. Would be nice if they specified whether their prepared foods are GF. Nice cooked stuff and salad bar but celiacs can’t touch. There are no labels on the salad bar stuff, I go here all the time and would know., A wide variety of GF grocery options!, If you're looking for gluten-free foods to cook with there are plenty of offerings. It's a grocery store after all. As far as prepared foods go though it's disappointing that a national ""health food"" store doesn't offer a small selection of made offsite ""fresh"" gluten-free baked goods. None of their prepared food items are made taking any allergy precautions., Plenty of standard gluten free items typical of Whole Foods. The best, however, is the variety of JPs gluten free baked goods they carry in a dedicated section of the bakery., Most of their hot food gives me a reaction, it is because they don’t use a dedicated gluten free kitchen., So many gluten free options. Service is great., Tons of options especially frozen products., Whole Foods is one of the Grocery stores that has the most gluten free stuff, desserts, crackers and more!🤩, Whole Foods has quality foods that are nearly impossible to find elsewhere., Lots of gf options. In chilled section, they have gf prepared meals., Very good selection of Gluten Free food. Nice fresh fruits and vegetables (many organic). Most outstanding feature is definitely their fish market; always fresh and top quality. Liquor department stocks Gluten Free beer (I highly recommend Lake Front Brewing) and cider. Prices are definitely high, but if you’re an Amazon Prime member they have significant discounts on selected items., I can always count on Whole Foods Market to have on their shelves the best quality gluten-free ingredients. I’ve been shopping at whole foods market since 1990!, Awesome selection of gluten free groceries, including multiple brands!, Huge store offering a variety of different gluten-free cereals and flour. Without oats and with gluten-free oats. I think celiacs find there a lot to have something to choose for breakfast., Soup and salad bar is marked very well for allergens. I have never got sick..., They have a good cracker and frozen foods selection especially for high-quality pasta and breaded items. I’m not impressed with its hot bar items. They have palatable frozen pastries and breads but they are a bit expensive and sometimes lack visual appeal because they are broken or have icicles. Once I bought a box of cookies and went to the car for a carb fest. I opened the box and every cookie was broken. I literally had nothing but crumbs and chocolate chips. I declined repurchase. This wasn’t an isolated incident. Whole Foods should be more careful with the shipping and handling of its gluten-free foods due to their composition and fragility.... Unfortunately, Whole foods could do a little better with eliminating unnecessary wheat/gluten products from some ready-made meals; for example, wheat berries or croutons in salads; use tamari instead of soy sauce in marinades., Grabbed a gluten free prepared meal on the way to a restaurant where I knew I couldn’t eat anything. The Pad Thai-esque dish with zucchini noodles was quite good, but pricey. They also have cake from By the Way Bakery., I shop here frequently. They have a ton of options! They also carry a selection of Cherbourg Cyprus desserts in the cold case., Hot bar has very limited gluten free options, and even fewer gluten free proteins. Salad/cold bar has a bit more but when I’m getting prepared food I prefer hot. I was going to get a questionable sushi roll and a bottle of GF soy sauce (they don’t offer GF) but decided to go a couple minutes down the street to Wegmans instead., I would expect a better selection for a place like Whole Foods. Overall, I don't find it worth my time, except for the ""Mybread"" Pita bread in the GF frozen section. Otherwise, I don't find their options to be all that much better than a regular grocery store. And there definitely isn't any pre-made food that is celiac safe if you're looking for a meal on the go., Kind of surprised that Whole Foods in-store restaurant can’t provide a list of allergen info of their menu items. The guy behind the counter had no clue what gluten free even meant. Wow, very disappointed., They have GF options for their restaurant area, sandwich bar, and sushi. The options are limited though and definitely no Celiac friendly. As a grocery store, they have several items that are GF and Celiac friendly., At most Whole Foods GF baked goods are in the freezer section....yup, bummer there is always very little in way of fresh GF baked stuff at WF’s, they did not have many gluten free options in the first place all i could get from the hot foods was mashed potatoes and then had a reaction directly after. definitely some cross contamination happening, one of the only supermarkets in New York where I could find a decent pack of glutenfree (factory) bread. You can also buy glutenfree muffins (freezer), cookies, flour etc., Some deserts are really good but everything gf there is so overpriced., While I don't typically grocery shop here, the chain as a whole is a go-to and a godsend while traveling if you need gluten free or any other allergy free items. The buffet always has options, even in smaller stores like this one, and allergens are marked., Before it was Amazon-owned, I shopped at this WF weekly for most of my groceries. Since then, they no longer carry many of the GF items I used to purchase, including cereals, crackers, snacks. They have substituted other cereals and snacks that have more sugar and less protein than I used to get. Fortunately there are other stores in the area that now carry more products that are GF, unlike when this store first opened., They used to be great about listing ingredients. It’s kind of hit and miss now. Lately the food seems like it is not very fresh. It seems like the food sits for a long time., Great choices but pretty spendy., Not much choices... store disposition was strange., I talked to a chef making taco items who was very rude and unwilling to discuss options with me. He told me that nothing in the made to order, pre-packaged, salad bar area was considered gluten free and said it as if it was absurd for me to not know that., Ate at the buffet/salad bar with no issues. I steer clear from items that are next to gluten items and therefore avoid CC issues. The store itself has a lot of GF items, especially in the frozen/refrigerated sections. Personal-sized cakes, breads, and cheesecakes!, Hot food bar is all labeled if dishes contain wheat, and they have a decent variety of store brand, cheaper gf options., Good selection of GF food at hot bar, you just have to be vigilant about reading all labels before you get something. And of course there are tons of gluten free options throughout the store., The staff was awesome! Francisca asked about my sensitivity and created a separate work station for me. She’s great! Can’t say enough good things, Good old Whole Foods. They carry plenty of delicious GF brands, even Beyond Bread breads. Great for stocking up your kitchen or for a picnic in the park, Love the salad & hot food bar at whole foods. All the items are marked with allergens & there’s very few items with gluten so comfortable with the cross contamination risk of a salad bar. Just just fill your take out box with roast meats, hot sides & salads, Great selection. They have gluten free ravioli in the fresh section and they are so good!, There are many opción gluten free but NO a lot, They make no effort to keep any prepared foods away from contamination such as placing crusty bread on top of the salad bar with crumbs falling everywhere, etc. Labeling looks promising but if you look closely they are often wrong, not matching up with actual food, many don't have allergens listed and use odd wording like graham instead of wheat. Overall, really frustrating that a supposedly healthy store makes zero effort to try and make their foods safe., Of all grocery stores, I find Whole Foods to be one of the most gluten free friendly. Tons of good options. Just make you read the labels!, Great selection of gluten free items!, No fresh gluten free items in the bakery. Very disappointing that the few gf items are frozen or bulk packaged.","LIDA SUSAN,Ria,Breanna,Tammy,Asok,gflindsey,GFREE,ashley,N.,Brian,Asok,Maureen,Vin,Nina W,Abbey,ksm,gf-Frank,Margie,Sophie,Martin,Upright Construction,Renee Matthewa,gfteacher20,Melissa,Kelsey,glutenfreecookie,Amy Marois,Justine,KKJ,hayley ,Renske,Ella,Abby,jill,kia,Krista4208,Matthew,Ashley,Lauren,Angela,Gretchen,AshleyA17,maya,Hayley,Nicole,Regi,sharon309,Julia,Liz,Carol",CO,20,5,36,80304

The pizza is delicious, but it is overly expensive. I can get it for a lot cheaper elsewhere in town., I used to love to come to this place. They took such care to avoid contamination. However the new owner literally told me celiac was my problem and the franchises don't have to take any precautions to keep contamination down. He then asked if I ever got sick there before as if questioning my illness! ""Yes even when they took precautions I did get sick on occasion tracing it back to an employee who's uniform was covered in flour and flour in the tomatoes. But the older owners made it right."" I am now boycotting Nick and Willys, I don't need that kind of treatment!, Really good GF BBQ chicken pizza. Had side salad too. Very good but did not like their choice for salad dressings by Ken -- too much garbage in it & their credo says only the best., The service here is great! They know how to make a tasty GF pizza while taking the precautions necessary so someone with Celiac won't get sick. All but 2 items on their menu can be made GF. We were especially happy to have a dessert pizza! (They sprinkle oats on top, but just left them off for us.), Big kahuna was delicious!! Great gluten free food, Came in from out of town, saw the reviews and gave it a try. Very good GF crust, it had good flavor and they cooked it well. Would highly recommend it., Great service, and great tasting pizza. It's worth clarifying whether or not you have an actual allergy or not - I said that I had celiac, and they pulled out all the stops (clean pan, clean utensils, parchment paper on the pan, top shelf in the oven, pulled toppings from a non-contaminated bin). I got the Garden Veggie pizza, which was full of veggies and really tasty. The staff was really friendly and wanted to know how I found out about their gluten free options. Especially on a long road trip, this place is a life-saver!, this place is a true gluten free place. the pizza is made in sperarte prep station. the crust is so tasty. you also are not limited on topping for the pizza! I recommend this place to everyone!, It seems silly to say I'm afraid of ordering pizza out at restaurants - especially when I'm traveling on vacation- but it's true! I called ahead and confirmed that this restaurant uses a separate prep area - separate ingredients - and parchment paper in the oven and yeeeeaaaaahhhhhhh! Yummy pizza that didn't make my sensitive celiac guts cry out in pain for eating it!!!! I'm sooooo thankful for the others who reviewed this place and gave me the confidence to try it!, Driving thru town & hungry for pizza - great gf pizza!! Actually might be the best gf pizza I've eaten & I've had a lot. I was hesitant to try when I saw it was just a small location in a shopping center but it more than surpassed my expectations! Customer service was exceptional!! Now I'm just disappointed that it's about 1000 miles from home. :), This is really the only place we know for sure is safe. They have a separate area to prepare food. They use parchment paper is the grill. We have been going here for years without problem., I think their gluten free pizza crusty is better than just about everywhere I've had a gluten free pizza crust. Really like the flavor of the crust! Great topping options too., Pizza is fine and service is good but the next day, I felt like.....yeah, not good. My pizza was run through the same oven as other non gf items and there is flour on many surfaces. Hard to avoid in a pizza place, I know., Wonderful place but if you are very sensitive becareful...crosscontamination is high. I didn't risk the pizza. The Greek salad was amazing.!, Eaten here twice, sick twice. Never again., this pizza is a great gluten free experience. many other gluten free pizzas us bean paste which leaves a film on your teeth that drives you nuts.
Nick and Willies had no after taste made fresh and tastes great! The New Grist is also a good gluten free beer. Although I buy a bunch to take home., Great GF pizza! They weren't able to make us a custom salad, which seems odd., Bought three gluten free pizzas, two ""Margheritas""and one ""Garden Veggie"", no mushroom. The gluten free is only offered in the medium size, and one medium is enough for two eaters. We had plenty! It was fresh and delicious, and safe to eat. Crust was soft and chewy, and not too thin nor sugary. Also bought one non-gluten free Meat Eaters pizza, and was told that was delicious, too., A little pricey but I've never had a problem! My husband and I order 1 gluten free pre bake and it feeds us both! Just get the meat topping and add your own veggies at home to help the cost 😉, For those of us who know what gluten free pizza tasted like, this tastes just the same while being safe for us to eat! Amazing service, they really take care of you., Excelent all around. I really thought the price was reasonable too!!, We shared a gluten free medium margarita pizza. Great pizza! Wonderful flavor! Service was awesome. We'll come again next time we're in town!, Love their GF pizza! It's a little pricey but it's larger than most other places GF pizzas. Would easily feed two, hungry adults!, They have my favorite gf pizza in Kenosha! They will make as many accommodations as possible to let you have any of their speciality pizzas on a gf crust. Not all of the staff knows the gf status of each topping, so you need to ask a few questions, but they are always helpful and friendly about it., Best tasting gluten free pizza crust we have had! The rest was delicious also!, The gf pizza was ok. It wasn't like cardboard, the crust was not bad. There really wasn't any flavor or anything special however., Good pizza and gluten free beer!, The guy was very knowledgable and helpful. The pizza was delicious and I did not get sick!, Best gluten free pizza around., My S.O. Brought me here talking about the ""best pizza in California"" and I expected to get a salad. Wrong! They have a yummy gluten free herb crust! Joy was so accommodating and friendly! It turns out he was right, and the pizza was nomlicious! We've now made coming here a tradition when we go to either Six Flags park nearby., Their gluten-free pizza crust is made from a coconut flour base. It's pretty decent pizza, and they can crank one out for you in a pinch. It's located inside the King Soopers grocery store so I often order my pizza, then do my grocery shopping, and then pick up the pizza on my way out., Excellent pizza! Crisp crust and loaded with their usual creative toppings. I have learned to avoid all sausage since they only guarantee gluten free crust. Staff friendly and as helpful as high school kids can be. They simply cannot eliminate the flour in the shop, so be careful if you are super sensitive. I'm not, and have had good luck., Very good but small gluten free slice for 4 bucks, Worker could not have been more rude. Repeatedly went out of his way to let us know how much we were inconveniencing him to make it gluten-free. Would rather eat grass than give him my business again., The best gluten fee pizza I have ever had!!!! Amazing crust yummmmmmy!!!, The best gf pizza around! Excited that they are now serving gluten free slices! staff was very helpful and friendly! we'll definitely be going back soon, love having pizza again!, Great flavor but the crust if cross-contaminated with gluten if you have Celiac Disease., Excellent. They have specific procedures they follow while handling their gluten free pizzas. They do a good job cleaning the oven. Usually they keep the top oven clean for gluten-free guests. I have eaten here several times and never had a reaction. If you don't want to risk it, they also have a take and bake option. They are a bit expensive, but well worth it., I really enjoyed their pizza, it was expensive, but when I am craving pizza and I don't want to feel miserable afterwards, I am all for theirs. I would reccomend them to anyone., great ...  always a fav when we head up to Kenosha!!, Flavor of crust was pretty good. Sadly, they are big on cross contamination. I felt the ill effects shortly after leaving., Great....Gluten free crust. How ever their meat and sauces are not. What's the point!, very good pizza watched it preped in gf free area staff very friendly and knew what they were doing., Loved the texture and taste, but I did suffer discomfort after eating the pizza. Way to much flour floating around and the staff did not even attempt to make it safe., My favorite gluten free pizza, Love their Gluten Free pizza. Unfortunately, they are quite expensive and coupons never work for GF pizzas., quite tasty! fast and fresh. while they took every precaution a fast food place can take, pulling ingredient from 'fresh' totes, none of the toppings contain gluten btw, wiping down the oven etc, it may not be for the super sensitive among us.","mjn1990,Celiac Cassie,Maureen W,Cassie,Kendra,Purple4199,Kate,Catherine,Susan from Colorado,Melissa,Stephanie,Courtnie ,erikamerica,Allison,Cheryl,Jeffrey,Tama,G Free Traveller,Amber C,B,Christine,celiac hubby,Gin75,AndrewandHolly,Sherry Watts,nnnchewchewchew,debvee,LG,Kate,Sammy Joe,Justin,KEA,Marky ,Clay H.,Jace,User,AV,Eric S.,daisy,Diana,Tlu88,User,fd122,Tlu88,Sean,User,Sarah",CO,8,3,20,80302

Their kitchens are not gluten free environments., My son has Celiac and pizza hut is amazing. Their gluten free pizza is delicious and my kiddo has never gotten size from it.

This pizza is ehh but when you have no other options it’s not too bad. Taste better than dominos surprisingly. They just make an Udi’s crust and wrap it before throwing it in the oven. I wouldn’t consider it Celiac safe though...probably cross contaminated, Uses the typical Pizza Hut GF protocol. Our celiac child has eaten there at least a half dozen times with no reaction.

No reviews have been written for this business.... Chipotle is one of my ""go to"" places. I visited this location while in town and it was great., Traveling with celiac can be emotionally draining. I walked in and asked if they were familiar with what gluten is, no hesitation and was answered yes, gloves off, hands washed, new gloves on and started changing utensils. All the employees seemed to know how to handle things to keep me safe. A thank you to the employees there is not really enough as the same restaurant down the road looked at me like I was crazy when I asked about gluten free options. Great lunch with great service, can’t beat that!😊, They’re always willing to Change gloves and I feel safe eating there., I always get sick from this place. I mention my allergy and they change their gloves/ get separate spoons but they put the spoons in the same main containers.... their chips are NOT gluten free. They told me they were and I got very sick not educated at all apparently, Had no clue what gluten free is despite their menu offering a gluten free tortilla or taco shell., Every filling is gf.
The only thing not gf is the tortilla. Which is sad because real tortilla are made from corn not wheat.
Take the bowl then, Will wash hands, change gloves and use disposable scoopers if you inform them of your ""allergy."" Everything is gluten free except for the burrito wraps. The shredded cheese and lettuce is grabbed with their gloves so it would be cross contaminated. They will get fresh from the back if you ask. I just try to avoid going when it's busy as to not hold up the line. 🤷🏼, I asked them to change gloves because of an allergy to the tortilla. He immediately dropped the tortilla he was holding directly over top of the rice containers. Then washed his hands, changed gloves and grabbed the empty tortilla wrapper. He crumpled it up threw it away and then asked if I wanted a fresh tortilla and opened the new tortillas..... Need I say more?, i found a long strand of hair in my burrito and the rice was definitely undercooked, i could taste how hard some rice were. the meat was dry and too bland. everything was too salty and i couldnt even finish my food.

Were very helpful and kind., I got sick, not celiac friendly, Wipe down the counters/where they make the food, change gloves, utensils, and get fresh toppings specifically for allergies... quality and quantity is about the same as if someone wasn’t ordering gluten free... Manager trained a new worker right in front of me and he was extremely knowledgeable and careful about cross contamination., DO NOT GET CHEESE ! I repeat do not get cheese. Even if employees change gloves the cheese is still extremely contaminated. Watch the employees hands as they make someone's food. The first thing they do is touch a tortilla with their glove. The last thing they do is touch the cheese WITH THEIR GLOVE., Always have been knowledgeable and changed gloves and pulled food from fresh containers to avoid cross contamination when informed., Stopped by on our way to South Dakata. They did a great job with preparing my food safely!, When I was here and mentioned I had celiac, staff wiped everything down, took out old spoons from the containers, washed hands/changed gloves, then put got clean utensils and new lettuce. Didn’t even have to ask them to change gloves or get new utensils! Very well trained!, Chipotle ALWAYS gets it right! They wash hands, change gloves, switch utensils, & inform all of the staff down the line! They’re the best & ROCK SOLID for a celiac, especially during travel!... Corn based & fantastic! The only flour in the kitchen is the large burrito wraps, all else is GF!... Eating here is 100% safe, 100% of the time🔥, The only thing with gluten here is the tortillas.

I just say that I have celiac and they change their gloves and get clean spoons. And they don’t touch the serving spoon to anyone’s food.... The only thing that has gluten is the tortilla.... It’s my go to place for lunch or dinner, Love this place! It’s my favorite fast food place to go to because the only thing that isn’t gf is their flour tortillas., No precautions taken at all. If you wait in line and watch them, it’s basically gluten city. Asking them to change gloves (or put some on because they often don’t wear any) is irrelevant because they touch the flour tortillas with all utensils and allow everything to contact other items. Frequently they’ll overfill and put an ingredient BACK in the tray. So there’s massive x-contamination. DANGER!, They have gloves on and a plexiglass in front of the food and during this crisis they have masks on at all times... You can have a bowl with the same toppings as a burrito, This is seriously the most conscientious Chipotle I have ever eaten in. I live nearby and eat here about once a month. They change all the spoons, wipe down the counter and get out fresh lettuce for me. I have never gotten sick at this location. They are the best. Just let them know before you order and they will take care of you. I am not celiac but very sensitive., They did not change their gloves. Told me they ran out of separate toppings. Same work space... It May have just been this location because usually all chipotles are a safer option, but they told me they ran out of toppings and just threw what they could in my bowel. The same toppings that were touched by flour tortillas and I’m sure there was cross contamination! Truly disappointing! 1 Star, Staff didn’t know what to do . Needed to be asked to put in clean gloves and reminded to use clean utensils. The last time I went to this location I thought they were knowledgeable and did a nice job. Today’s crew had not been trained properly. Also their COVID-19 precautions were very lax. Masks worn improperly or around their necks. Probably won’t be back.... Their COVID-19 precautions were very lax. Masks worn improperly or around their necks. Probably won’t be back., Honestly, I’ve gotten sick eating here twice mostly because I do not think the staff cared about my allergy. Only at a few bites and got sick quick. I ordered according to their online menu that was GF, They do wipe down the counters and change their gloves after washing their hands. They take out the condiments straight from the bag below the buffet style service., The staff was polite and changed gloves when I ordered my rice bowl. However, I noticed as they made someone else's burrito that the serving spoons touched the flour shell and then they put the spoon back in the container. I got extremely sick and suspect it was from cross contamination on the spoons., I have a very sensitive gluten intolerance and every time I try their food I get my symptoms... Only on their website/ nutrition info you can find gluten free information, They are very nice and will always change gloves when asked.

Cross-contamination is a concern, however, so let the person taking your order know that you are gluten free and if you need them to take the proper precautions.
From their website: ""If you avoid gluten, don't eat our flour tortillas. If you are highly sensitive to gluten and would like us to change our gloves, just let us know at the start of your order. You should be aware items containing corn, including corn tortillas (chips, soft corn, and crispy corn tortillas) and corn salsa, may have a small amount of gluten from potentially co-mingling with gluten-containing grains in the field.""... No reviews have been written for this business.... Chipotle is one of my ""go to"" places. I visited this location while in town and it was great., Traveling with celiac can be emotionally draining. I walked in and asked if they were familiar with what gluten is, no hesitation and was answered yes, gloves off, hands washed, new gloves on and started changing utensils. All the employees seemed to know how to handle things to keep me safe. A thank you to the employees there is not really enough as the same restaurant down the road looked at me like I was crazy when I asked about gluten free options. Great lunch with great service, can’t beat that!😊, They’re always willing to Change gloves and I feel safe eating there., I always get sick from this place. I mention my allergy and they change their gloves/ get separate spoons but they put the spoons in the same main containers.... their chips are NOT gluten free. They told me they were and I got very sick not educated at all apparently, Had no clue what gluten free is despite their menu offering a gluten free tortilla or taco shell., Every filling is gf.
The only thing not gf is the tortilla. Which is sad because real tortilla are made from corn not wheat.
Take the bowl then, Will wash hands, change gloves and use disposable scoopers if you inform them of your ""allergy."" Everything is gluten free except for the burrito wraps. The shredded cheese and lettuce is grabbed with their gloves so it would be cross contaminated. They will get fresh from the back if you ask. I just try to avoid going when it's busy as to not hold up the line. 🤷🏼, I asked them to change gloves because of an allergy to the tortilla. He immediately dropped the tortilla he was holding directly over top of the rice containers. Then washed his hands, changed gloves and grabbed the empty tortilla wrapper. He crumpled it up threw it away and then asked if I wanted a fresh tortilla and opened the new tortillas..... Need I say more?, i found a long strand of hair in my burrito and the rice was definitely undercooked, i could taste how hard some rice were. the meat was dry and too bland. everything was too salty and i couldnt even finish my food.

Manager trained a new worker right in front of me and he was extremely knowledgeable and careful about cross contamination., DO NOT GET CHEESE ! I repeat do not get cheese. Even if employees change gloves the cheese is still extremely contaminated. Watch the employees hands as they make someone's food. The first thing they do is touch a tortilla with their glove. The last thing they do is touch the cheese WITH THEIR GLOVE., Always have been knowledgeable and changed gloves and pulled food from fresh containers to avoid cross contamination when informed., Stopped by on our way to South Dakata.

It’s my go to place for lunch or dinner, Love this place! It’s my favorite fast food place to go to because the only thing that isn’t gf is their flour tortillas., No precautions taken at all. If you wait in line and watch them, it’s basically gluten city. Asking them to change gloves (or put some on because they often don’t wear any) is irrelevant because they touch the flour tortillas with all utensils and allow everything to contact other items. Frequently they’ll overfill and put an ingredient BACK in the tray. So there’s massive x-contamination. DANGER!, They have gloves on and a plexiglass in front of the food and during this crisis they have masks on at all times... You can have a bowl with the same toppings as a burrito, This is seriously the most conscientious Chipotle I have ever eaten in. I live nearby and eat here about once a month.

Just let them know before you order and they will take care of you. I am not celiac but very sensitive., They did not change their gloves. Told me they ran out of separate toppings. Same work space... It May have just been this location because usually all chipotles are a safer option, but they told me they ran out of toppings and just threw what they could in my bowel. The same toppings that were touched by flour tortillas and I’m sure there was cross contamination! Truly disappointing! 1 Star, Staff didn’t know what to do . Needed to be asked to put in clean gloves and reminded to use clean utensils. The last time I went to this location I thought they were knowledgeable and did a nice job.

They take out the condiments straight from the bag below the buffet style service., The staff was polite and changed gloves when I ordered my rice bowl. However, I noticed as they made someone else's burrito that the serving spoons touched the flour shell and then they put the spoon back in the container.

This pizza is ehh but when you have no other options it’s not too bad. Taste better than dominos surprisingly. They just make an Udi’s crust and wrap it before throwing it in the oven. I wouldn’t consider it Celiac safe though...probably cross contaminated, Uses the typical Pizza Hut GF protocol. Our celiac child has eaten there at least a half dozen times with no reaction. But the wait staff is often not knowledgeable (or doesn’t care) about celiac. I’d say it’s the type of service and product that you might expect from a pizza chain., This location no longer offers GF pizza, Not safe at all. Cross-contamination is bad and nobody adheres to gluten-free needs. I used to work here. Never ever eat here if you have Celiac issues., I have strictly gluten free for around 4 years. Pizza Hut has always been that last minute food place that I can pick up pizzas for me (and my gluten free family) and we have had very little problems with this Pizza Hut. They use plastic cutting straight out of a package and change their gloves for their gluten free customers. I have been very satisfied with this Pizza Hut., Pizzahut has a gluten free pizza, but it only comes in a small and is $14., Called to check GF Menu. They currently have no items that are Gluten Free., I have been to pizza hut hundreds of times throughout the country and they dont do a gluten free pizza., Got rid of their GF crust option","Zac,Emily,Nicole,rod5,Jae-Elle,Katherine,hulsy18,Cottonwoodz,Sharon,Dawn,Lyssa,Damien,Nevaeh,Ryan Morales,Jami Carlton,Devin,Renee,Sherri,Brandie,John,Lynda,Lisa,Jake,Julie,Ryan Morales,Adriana Buczynskyj ,Elaine Lambert,Lisa,Lisa,Kelly D.,PageR,Ashley,Whitley,Lara,Carmen,Leila,Justin,Jennifer,Diana,Emma,Janell,m,Heather,Misty,Kate,Alex,Heidi putman,Ashley,Fred,Dan",CO,7,16,41,80220

Cross-contamination is a concern, however, so let the person taking your order know that you are gluten free and if you need them to take the proper precautions.
From their website: ""If you avoid gluten, don't eat our flour tortillas. If you are highly sensitive to gluten and would like us to change our gloves, just let us know at the start of your order. You should be aware items containing corn, including corn tortillas (chips, soft corn, and crispy corn tortillas) and corn salsa, may have a small amount of gluten from potentially co-mingling with gluten-containing grains in the field.""... No reviews have been written for this business.... Chipotle is one of my ""go to"" places. I visited this location while in town and it was great., Traveling with celiac can be emotionally draining. I walked in and asked if they were familiar with what gluten is, no hesitation and was answered yes, gloves off, hands washed, new gloves on and started changing utensils. All the employees seemed to know how to handle things to keep me safe. A thank you to the employees there is not really enough as the same restaurant down the road looked at me like I was crazy when I asked about gluten free options. Great lunch with great service, can’t beat that!😊, They’re always willing to Change gloves and I feel safe eating there., I always get sick from this place. I mention my allergy and they change their gloves/ get separate spoons but they put the spoons in the same main containers.... their chips are NOT gluten free. They told me they were and I got very sick not educated at all apparently, Had no clue what gluten free is despite their menu offering a gluten free tortilla or taco shell., Every filling is gf.
The only thing not gf is the tortilla. Which is sad because real tortilla are made from corn not wheat.
Take the bowl then, Will wash hands, change gloves and use disposable scoopers if you inform them of your ""allergy."" Everything is gluten free except for the burrito wraps. The shredded cheese and lettuce is grabbed with their gloves so it would be cross contaminated. They will get fresh from the back if you ask. I just try to avoid going when it's busy as to not hold up the line. 🤷🏼, I asked them to change gloves because of an allergy to the tortilla. He immediately dropped the tortilla he was holding directly over top of the rice containers. Then washed his hands, changed gloves and grabbed the empty tortilla wrapper. He crumpled it up threw it away and then asked if I wanted a fresh tortilla and opened the new tortillas..... Need I say more?, i found a long strand of hair in my burrito and the rice was definitely undercooked, i could taste how hard some rice were. the meat was dry and too bland. everything was too salty and i couldnt even finish my food. TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!, They refused to serve me, citing cross-contamination. I even emailed their headquarters. They said no.... They refused to serve me, citing cross-contamination. I even emailed their headquarters. They said no.... They refused to serve me, citing cross-contamination. I even emailed their headquarters. They said no., Most things here are naturally gf, and staff will change gloves if asked.... Bowls, tacos, and salads can be gf, as are chips and even the queso, Many delicious gluten free options, I have been going to this location for years and have never had an issue with an employee not changing their gloves and wiping down the counter... Just say you have a gluten allergy and they will go change gloves!, We travel alot and give Chipotle for a quick easy meal. I am C but say gluten allergy for ease of explanation. They changed gloves. Were very helpful and kind., I got sick, not celiac friendly, Wipe down the counters/where they make the food, change gloves, utensils, and get fresh toppings specifically for allergies... quality and quantity is about the same as if someone wasn’t ordering gluten free... Manager trained a new worker right in front of me and he was extremely knowledgeable and careful about cross contamination., DO NOT GET CHEESE ! I repeat do not get cheese. Even if employees change gloves the cheese is still extremely contaminated. Watch the employees hands as they make someone's food. The first thing they do is touch a tortilla with their glove. The last thing they do is touch the cheese WITH THEIR GLOVE., Always have been knowledgeable and changed gloves and pulled food from fresh containers to avoid cross contamination when informed., Stopped by on our way to South Dakata. They did a great job with preparing my food safely!, When I was here and mentioned I had celiac, staff wiped everything down, took out old spoons from the containers, washed hands/changed gloves, then put got clean utensils and new lettuce. Didn’t even have to ask them to change gloves or get new utensils! Very well trained!, Chipotle ALWAYS gets it right! They wash hands, change gloves, switch utensils, & inform all of the staff down the line! They’re the best & ROCK SOLID for a celiac, especially during travel!... Corn based & fantastic! The only flour in the kitchen is the large burrito wraps, all else is GF!... Eating here is 100% safe, 100% of the time🔥, The only thing with gluten here is the tortillas. Get a bowl, and you won't have any problems at all. I've gone many times without even mentioning my allergy with no problems at all., Most of the time I don’t even have to explain. I just say that I have celiac and they change their gloves and get clean spoons. And they don’t touch the serving spoon to anyone’s food.... The only thing that has gluten is the tortilla.... It’s my go to place for lunch or dinner, Love this place! It’s my favorite fast food place to go to because the only thing that isn’t gf is their flour tortillas., No precautions taken at all. If you wait in line and watch them, it’s basically gluten city. Asking them to change gloves (or put some on because they often don’t wear any) is irrelevant because they touch the flour tortillas with all utensils and allow everything to contact other items. Frequently they’ll overfill and put an ingredient BACK in the tray. So there’s massive x-contamination. DANGER!, They have gloves on and a plexiglass in front of the food and during this crisis they have masks on at all times... You can have a bowl with the same toppings as a burrito, This is seriously the most conscientious Chipotle I have ever eaten in. I live nearby and eat here about once a month. They change all the spoons, wipe down the counter and get out fresh lettuce for me. I have never gotten sick at this location. They are the best. Just let them know before you order and they will take care of you. I am not celiac but very sensitive., They did not change their gloves. Told me they ran out of separate toppings. Same work space... It May have just been this location because usually all chipotles are a safer option, but they told me they ran out of toppings and just threw what they could in my bowel. The same toppings that were touched by flour tortillas and I’m sure there was cross contamination! Truly disappointing! 1 Star, Staff didn’t know what to do . Needed to be asked to put in clean gloves and reminded to use clean utensils. The last time I went to this location I thought they were knowledgeable and did a nice job. Today’s crew had not been trained properly. Also their COVID-19 precautions were very lax. Masks worn improperly or around their necks. Probably won’t be back.... Their COVID-19 precautions were very lax. Masks worn improperly or around their necks. Probably won’t be back., Honestly, I’ve gotten sick eating here twice mostly because I do not think the staff cared about my allergy. Only at a few bites and got sick quick. I ordered according to their online menu that was GF, They do wipe down the counters and change their gloves after washing their hands. They take out the condiments straight from the bag below the buffet style service., The staff was polite and changed gloves when I ordered my rice bowl. However, I noticed as they made someone else's burrito that the serving spoons touched the flour shell and then they put the spoon back in the container. I got extremely sick and suspect it was from cross contamination on the spoons., I have a very sensitive gluten intolerance and every time I try their food I get my symptoms... Only on their website/ nutrition info you can find gluten free information, They are very nice and will always change gloves when asked. I have never in my life gotten sick, and I have eaten here a lot.... If you eat here you cannot get a burrito or a taco, but you can get a bowl! The bowls have all the same stuff that the burritos and tacos have, except for the shell/wrap/tortilla. Everything they put inside the food is gluten free. The chips are also all gluten-free corn chips., They do use flour wraps. But if you tell the worker you are gluten free they will change their gloves, change the spoons, and should also change the lettuce and cheese containers since they stick their hands in with the gluten gloves... Very yummy of course. Gone here for years., Kudos to the manager who upon learning that one of the meals was for a celiac (gluten free) person stepped in and with GREAT personal and serving care assured that there was no cross contamination. 5 Stars for the extraordinary care that was exercised, Workers will change gloves, wash hands, wipe down counter, and bag meals separately. They are compliant and very kind!... Everything at Chipotle is gluten free except the tortillas., Everything at Chipotle is gluten free except the flour tortillas. I LOVE having so many choices!!!, They’ve definitely gone downhill. Last time I got their food, it wasn’t very good (dry chicken, missing ingredients) and I was sick afterwards for several days. Can no longer recommend, I love chipotle! They never disappoint, they always give you a good amount of food. I usually get a bowl and most items on their menu are gluten free and celiac safe., The folks working here were super conscientious about changing gloves, wiping the counter, and using new tongs when I told them of my gluten allergy. The food was great and I feel great!, Cross contamination is high if they don’t change gloves or use fresh utensils. Not Celiac safe. Informed them of this but my meal had evidence of other salsas and meat, so it appears utensils were not changed even though requested. Stopped eating as soon as saw this but still having gluten reaction, Will change gloves, wash hands, and get separate cheese and lettuce if you ask. It really depends on the person you get when you order though. I’ve had both really good and really bad experiences. Most of the time the workers are very friendly but I’ve had a few of the workers get visibly irritated when I tell them I have celiacs.... The food is always good. I love getting the rice bowls and they’re fantastic.... I would give it 5 starts if some of the employees weren’t so rude. A few get visibly upset when they have to wash their hands and change their gloves. It’s just an unsettling feeling when they’re making your food and it’s honestly just really rude., Delicious clean ingredients and they’ll change their gloves and spoons if you tell them you’re gluten free., I've eaten at other chipotles and been ok, but I'm having a major wheat reaction this morning. It's possible it's one of my other sensitivities, but none of them give me this reaction that I know of. ... When I ordered, I told the server about my restrictions. He didn't change his gloves like I've seen at other franchises, nor replace the serving utensils. Like an idiot, I didn't ask him to because I didn't anticipate it being a big deal. And I didn't want to make his life harder during the pandemic. But... Ow., Will wash hands and change gloves if you ask.","Sara,JW,Mic,Keena,merilyn,Lauren,Marcduf,Kassie,Mark,Luna,Marsha,Meghan,Leanne,Caleb ,Monique,Katie,aanya,Wil,Ttomeo,Mike,Elizabeth,Marcie Ellen,Zach,Krista,Amelia,Joey,Lucy,Corbin,KarenW,Breanna,chris,LeeAnna Collier,Madalyn,Michelle,Courtney,Sarah,LaÉabha,Brenna Tkac,Tom,Nora,Jenny,Suzanne,Maia,Celia,Amy,JillianKara,Talia,jennifer,K,sophie herrema",CO,4,2,34,80206
